MRY1_AFLEE_02 = ~z~Come on, Jamie! Your sister's worried about you.

MRY1_AFLEE_03 = ~z~Damn it, we got to do this the hard way?

MRY1_AFLEE_04 = ~z~For chrissakes, Jamie. Just hold up a minute!

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_1 = ~z~Well, ~rp~this wasn't how I thought today would turn out.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.5~It's been a long time, Jamie Gillis. ~rp~You were a kid last time I saw you,~sl:0.5~and didn't try to kill yourself.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_3 = ~z~You know, ~rp~you taught me how to ride a horse.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_4 = ~z~Too well, apparently. ~rp~Chelonia, though? ~rp~Really, you'd fall for that?

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_5 = ~z~They were very nice to me. ~rp~They're decent.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_6 = ~z~I'm sure. ~rp~Please tell me you didn't give them any money.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_7 = ~z~Of course I did. ~rp~They rely on charitable donations.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_8 = ~z~Jesus, Jamie. Come on.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~I just wanted to believe that there might be something good...~sl:~coming my way one day.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~Shut up.~lr:1.0:3.5~All father kept telling me was ~rp~“you won't amount to anything”,~lr:0.1~“you're not enough of a man”...

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_13 = ~z~I had to get away. ~rp~I couldn't take it any more.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_14 = ~z~Forgive me, but your father's a bully and a coward, don't listen to him.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_15 = ~z~Hey, don't talk about him like that.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_16 = ~z~What do you want me to say, Jamie? ~rp~He's a good father? ~rp~A nice man?

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_17 = ~z~He won't be happy I saw you.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_18 = ~z~Please send him my worst regards.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_19 = ~z~Thing is... he's right. ~rp~I'm not good at anything.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_20 = ~z~Come on, that ain't true. ~rp~Tell me something you like.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_27 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I was thinking more along the lines of...~sl:0.0:2.6~carpentry or horses or something, but...~lr:0.4~alright, go work in an orchard then.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_28 = ~z~By that token, you must really like shooting and robbing people.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_29 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I only like shooting young idiots who run away from me...~sl:~when I'm trying to help them.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_30 = ~z~Father told me what you do.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_32 = ~z~Are you still with Dutch and, what was his name... Hester?

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_33 = ~z~Hosea. Yep, ~rp~still the same, sort of.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_34 = ~z~And Annabelle and Bessie?

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_35 = ~z~I'm afraid they're dead.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_36 = ~z~Shit, ~rp~maybe Mary did make the right choice.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_37 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~No doubt.~lr:0.4~But none of it is anything like the nonsense you read in the newspapers.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_38 = ~z~So are you two getting back together?

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_42 = ~z~So the door's open, so to speak.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_43 = ~z~That's all in the past, ~rp~we're different people now.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_44 = ~z~She's not, and you seem just the same.

MRY1_AJRIDETALK_45 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Well, maybe that right there's the problem.~lr:0.6~She was always too good for me.
