DST1_IG2_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bell,~sl:0.2~you two take up a hidden position just outside the camp.

DST1_IG2_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Mr. Summers, Mr. Escuella,~sl:0.3~you two hold position here.

DST1_IG2_9 = ~z~Let's go.

DST1_IG3_P1_A_1 = ~z~There they are...

DST1_IG3_P1_A_2 = ~z~That's definitely them.

DST1_IG3_P1_A_3 = ~z~Colm?

DST1_IG3_P1_A_4 = ~z~I think...

DST1_IG3_P1_A_5 = ~z~Yeah... that's him.

DST1_IG3_P1_B_1 = ~z~Who's he talking to? He don't seem very happy.

DST1_IG3_P1_B_2 = ~z~No...

DST1_IG3_P1_B_3 = ~z~Are they leaving?

DST1_IG3_P1_B_4 = ~z~Seem to be. Should we go get 'em?

DST1_IG3_P1_B_5 = ~z~No. Colm can wait. Best to get some of them outta there.

DST1_IG3_P2_A_1 = ~z~We here for Colm or the detonators?

DST1_IG3_P2_A_2 = ~z~Ideally both.

DST1_IG3_P2_A_3 = ~z~But in reality it seems to me, to be one or the other.

DST1_IG3_P2_A_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.6~I mean...~sl:1.4~we could hit 'em all hard now, probably lose more men,

DST1_IG3_P2_A_5 = ~z~maybe have the chance to kill Colm, or...

DST1_IG3_P2_A_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.7~we can wait, until Colm leaves with his best, rob him of his equipment...~sl:0.1~and leave 'em free to freeze up here.

DST1_IG3_P2_A_7 = ~z~

DST1_IG3_P2_A_8 = ~z~Which is it?

DST1_IG3_P2_A_9 = ~z~~sl:0.2:0.0~Look at you, all grown up and sensible. Hosea's taught you well.

DST1_IG3_P2_A_10 = ~z~You've taught me well... just, taught me to think a little.

DST1_IG3_P2_B_1 = ~z~I hate it when you're right.

DST1_IG3_P2_B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~It's the train...~sl:1.4~we'll let 'em get outta here.

DST1_IG5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.5:1.4~Good work, boys.~sl:0.1~Now, let's tear this place apart.

DST1_IG5_3 = ~z~Bill, you go search that wagon there.

DST1_IG5_4 = ~z~Micah, search that building.

DST1_IG5_5 = ~z~Arthur, you take that building to the left.

DST1_IG5_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Alright men, quick!~sl:0.2~Find those denotators, explosives, anything you can.

DST1_IG8_GL_C_R_1 = ~z~Okay, fine, you make the move.

DST1_IG8_TL_C_R_1 = ~z~Okay, I'll go first.

DST1_IG9_1 = ~z~Here... this looks good... what you think Bill?

DST1_IG9_2 = ~z~Looks fine... smells good.

DST1_IG9_3 = ~z~Come on.

DST1_IG10_1 = ~z~Search the bodies, strip everything we can from them!

DST1_IG10_BILL_1 = ~z~I think that's all of them!

DST1_IG10_SRCH1_1 = ~z~Keep searching the bodies, Arthur!

DST1_IG10_SRCH2_1 = ~z~Come on, Arthur, we need to strip them clean!

DST1_IG10_SRCH3_1 = ~z~Keep looking! We need everything we can get off of these bastards!

DST1_IG11_GOSEE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.6:0.0~Go see if you can find their dynamite. We're onto something interesting here...

DST1_INT_1 = ~z~up with you boys, because I thought you liked action.

DST1_INT_2 = ~z~Couple of days on the lam...

DST1_INT_3 = ~z~and you lot have all turned yella.

DST1_INT_4 = ~z~Apart from you, of course.

DST1_INT_5 = ~z~Shut up, Micah.

DST1_INT_6 = ~z~I ain't never seen so many long faces.

DST1_INT_7 = ~z~I guess...

DST1_INT_8 = ~z~I guess folks miss them... that fell.

DST1_INT_9 = ~z~Well, when I fall, I don't want no fuss.

DST1_INT_10 = ~z~When you fall...

DST1_INT_11 = ~z~there'll be a party.

DST1_INT_12 = ~z~A party...

DST1_INT_13 = ~z~probably.

DST1_INT_14 = ~z~That funny, huh?

DST1_INT_15 = ~z~Sure.

DST1_INT_16 = ~z~Maybe I don't feel like being laughed at by the likes of you two.

DST1_INT_17 = ~z~Stop it!

DST1_INT_18 = ~z~Now!

DST1_INT_19 = ~z~You fools punching each other...

DST1_INT_20 = ~z~when Colm O'Driscoll's needing punching, hard.

DST1_INT_21 = ~z~You wanna sit around waiting for him to come find us?

DST1_INT_22 = ~z~All of you, we got work to do.

DST1_INT_23 = ~z~Come on.

DST1_INT_24 = ~z~Are you sure about this, Dutch?

DST1_INT_25 = ~z~Yes.

DST1_INT_26 = ~z~Folks been through a lot recently...

DST1_INT_27 = ~z~we hardly back on our feet yet.

DST1_INT_28 = ~z~And the last thing we need is to get bushwhacked by Colm O'Driscoll.

DST1_INT_29 = ~z~Let's go.

DST1_INT_30 = ~z~I know you hate him, Dutch.

DST1_INT_31 = ~z~He's here for us.

DST1_INT_32 = ~z~I doubt that.

DST1_INT_33 = ~z~No, you're just doubting me.

DST1_INT_34 = ~z~I would never doubt you, Dutch, you...

DST1_INT_35 = ~z~you always said revenge is a luxury we can't afford.

DST1_INT_36 = ~z~This is the right call, Arthur.

DST1_INT_37 = ~z~Take this.

DST1_INT_38 = ~z~And this is about more than revenge for business long ago.

DST1_INT_39 = ~z~They were talking about trains and detonators.

DST1_INT_40 = ~z~Here.

DST1_INT_41 = ~z~Colm always had good information.

DST1_INT_42 = ~z~Come on.

DST1_INT_43 = ~z~And you think now is the right time to hit a train?

DST1_INT_44 = ~z~Now you might fancy living on deer piss and rabbit shit...

DST1_INT_45 = ~z~I'm getting too old for that life.

DST1_INT_46 = ~z~Mr. Matthews, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pearson...

DST1_INT_47 = ~z~would you please look after the place...

DST1_INT_48 = ~z~there are O'Driscolls about.

DST1_LENNY_02 = ~z~~sl:0.5:0.0~Sure thing.

DST1_LESSFUN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~And much less fun to rob him and his score~sl:~if he never finds out about it.

DST1_LOOTING1_1 = ~z~~sl:1.2~That'll show the bastards. I thought we'd seen the last of them out West.

DST1_LOOTING1_2 = ~z~I heard rumors they were running over in New Hanover now.

DST1_LOOTING1_3 = ~z~I just didn't expect to see them up in the Grizzlies.

DST1_LOOTING1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~If Colm's got his boys all the way up here,~sl:0.4~I reckon this train must be worth robbing.

DST1_LOOTING2_1 = ~z~You recognize any of them, Dutch?

DST1_LOOTING2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Of course not. Colm doesn't give a damn about his men.~sl:0.1~All he cares about is numbers.

DST1_LOOTING2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~If you can shoot a gun, and ride a horse,~sl:~and kill without thought, you're in.

DST1_LOOTING2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Think how long some of you have been with me?~sl:0.7~I imagine Colm doesn't even know half the names of these fools.

DST1_LOOTING3_1 = ~z~~sl:1.0:3.5:1~This one stinks worse than you, Williamson.

DST1_LOOTING3_2 = ~z~Just keep your dumb mouth shut... son of a bitch.

DST1_LOOTING3_3 = ~z~You want me to crack you again? The next one won't be a warning.

DST1_LOOTING3_4 = ~z~Why don't you try when Dutch ain't around to protect ya?

DST1_LOOTING3_5 = ~z~I told you two already. That is enough.

DST1_LOOTING3_6 = ~z~One day...

DST1_ONHORSE_6 = ~z~Duffy. Kieran Duffy.

DST1_ONHORSE_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well, I ain't gonna lie to you...~sl:0.8~this is a real bad day for you, Kieran Duffy.

DST1_ONHORSE_8 = ~z~Where are you taking me?

DST1_RETRIEVE_1_01 = ~z~Are you hearing me? You're going to need that rifle.

DST1_RETRIEVE_1_02 = ~z~Quick, grab that repeater and let's get moving.

DST1_RETRIEVE_1_03 = ~z~That rifle's no use to us sitting on your horse, Arthur.

DST1_RIDEOUTSHOUTED_9 = ~z~Especially when we rob this train too.

DST1_RIDEOUTSHOUTED_10 = ~z~~sl:1.9:0.0~Guess we'll see about that.

DST1_RIDEOUTSHOUTED_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~You know...~sl:1.0~he'll come after us.

DST1_RIDEOUTSHOUTED_13 = ~z~Of course he will, ~rp~like all the rest.
