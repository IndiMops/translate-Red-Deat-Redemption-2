MGSEA_ASN_BLW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Well, that's just fine because I've got something you'll like.~sl:~Being the angel of vengeance.

MGSEA_ASN_BLW_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Look, it's a filthy job, but someone has to do it...~sl:0.3~these bastards need killing, they do.

MGSEA_ASN_BLW_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~And for a killing, you need professionals.~sl:0.3~So I thought of you as being well-suited.

MGSEA_ASN_BLW_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~That's a compliment, so feel free to smile...~sl:0.8~it's a bunch of bastards in Blackwater, so it is.

MGSEA_ASN_BLW_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Bullies who have annoyed a lot of folk there,~sl:~and killed an acquaintance of mine. So vengeance must be sought.

MGSEA_ASN_BLW_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~And you're the seeker, on my behalf.~sl:0.4~He was a nice feller, Scottish lad he was.

MGSEA_ASN_BLW_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Left a widow and two wee kiddies, he did.~sl:0.5~Yeah... real shame.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Well that's just fine and dandy...~sl:0.6~as I've got something I wanted to tell you.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~So, I met this idiot the other night, right?~sl:0.4~ A real bloody moron they was...

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~You know, one of these yapping dogs with opinions on everything.~sl:1.0~The absolute worst.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_4 = ~z~And they particularly seemed to hate you.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~Now, I was tempted to kill them, then and there, on account of our friendship...~sl:~but in the end I decided against it.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_6 = ~z~I had a better idea. I'd leave them for you.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Because your boy Sean knows the only pleasure in shutting someone up,~sl:~is to shut them up personally.

MGSEA_ASN_PLYR_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I mean, well, there's only one way to end a blood feud...~sl:~and that's you killing them for yourself.

MGSEA_ASN_PSSE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Well good work I've got for you...~sl:~something fine and true and necessary.

MGSEA_ASN_PSSE_2 = ~z~The noble art of murder, no less. Yes, murder.

MGSEA_ASN_PSSE_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Now don't go all fucking high and mighty on us, eh, now?~sl:0.4~I know murder is not usually a noble art. But bear with me.

MGSEA_ASN_PSSE_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~They've been acting like they're the kings of the country, so they have,~sl:~and yous need to teach them a lesson.

MGSEA_ASN_PSSE_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~So go kill them. Every one of them.~sl:0.4~There's many a folk 'round here will pat you on the back.

MGSEA_ASN_PSSE_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~You're doing the work of the police so right you are...~sl:0.4~trust old Sean on this one... he'll see you right.

MGSEA_ASN_STLL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Well, that's good, because there's a gang I want to tell you all about.~sl:0.4~Right nasty bastards they is. Awful.

MGSEA_ASN_STLL_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~And even danced with lassies they wasn't engaged too.~sl:1.2~Well, that and... far too much goddamn killing of folk.

MGSEA_ASN_STLL_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~So you're going to kill them for me,~sl:0.4~and we'll both make a packet, we will. So good luck.

MGSEA_ASN_STLL_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Bastards are hiding out in Stillwater Creek and Manteca Falls,~sl:~south west of Thieves Landing...

MGSEA_AST_TALL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~I guessed as much...~sl:~by the way... you ever run into Freddie O'Hallaghan?

MGSEA_AST_TALL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Right shite he is, him and his boys.~sl:~I cannot stand them. And I ain't the only one...

MGSEA_AST_TALL_3 = ~z~There's a price on the streets for all their heads... pretty decent price and all.

MGSEA_AST_TALL_4 = ~z~~sl:0.3:2.3~And this has been coming for quite a while.~sl:~They've annoyed too many folk, both good and bad.

MGSEA_AST_TALL_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Done all manner of nasty shite.~sl:~Killed, robbed, molested animals. Been unkind to women and dogs.

MGSEA_AST_TALL_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~By the way, I like you, I do... I really do...~sl:0.3:3.6~I'm developing a sort of a... a friendship for you...~sl:~even though you lack a certain charm.

MGSEA_CH_BLW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~I supposed as much...~sl:1.6:3.7~You still ain't much of a conversationalist now, is you?

MGSEA_CH_BLW_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Anyway, that ain't my concern. Unlike robbery.~sl:~Robbery is my concern. Especially the noble art of highway robbery.

MGSEA_CH_BLW_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~My family has been robbing stage coaches for three hundred years...~sl:0.4~on two continents, we have...

MGSEA_CH_BLW_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~So I speak as a man of rare experience in the matter.~sl:0.5~So... I've got a stagecoach for yous, another one.

MGSEA_CH_BLW_5 = ~z~With plenty of loot hidden on it, so they was telling me, plenty of loot.

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_1 = ~z~Good. So, you ever been stabbed in the back by the government?

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_2 = ~z~Me neither, but by all accounts, it leaves a sour taste in the mouth.

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_3 = ~z~And my buddy Brendan is spitting vinegar and pissing bile.

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~He thought he had paid off some officials~sl:~to turn a blind eye to some... innocent smuggling.

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~But now the law has stabbed him in the back,~sl:~stolen his contraband and has a warrant out for his arrest.

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~So he needs yous to destroy all the evidence.~sl:0.4:2.0~It's on wagons from Manzanita~sl:~and passing through Tall Trees and Great Plains.

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Now, I understand why he's so mad, I mean...~sl:0.3~if you cannot trust a bribed official...

MGSEA_DM_MANZ_8 = ~z~Who can you trust? It's a bloody scandal, so it is.

MGSEA_DM_NGP_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.1~Good, now how do you feel about the police, dear friend?~sl:1.1~Because I'll level with you... I'm not much of a fan myself.

MGSEA_DM_NGP_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Always sticking their noses in, they are.~sl:0.2~And for what exactly?

MGSEA_DM_NGP_3 = ~z~To interfere and stop the natural order of things from playing out.

MGSEA_DM_NGP_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Now, I've got one word for that, and that word is not right.~sl:0.5~It's not right.

MGSEA_DM_NGP_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~They've framed a friend of mine, Alan.~sl:0.4:2.3~They framed him for a crime he did commit.~sl:0.3~But... committed fair and square.

MGSEA_DM_NGP_6 = ~z~And now they want to kill him, they do.

MGSEA_DM_NGP_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~So, you'll have to destroy all the evidence they're taking~sl:~from Blackwater... through Great Plains. Alright?

MGSEA_DS_AURO_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Good... good...~sl:0.4~because I've got a fine bit of business you might be interested in.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Something to sink your teeth into... deep into...~sl:0.6~you'll love it.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~You know about the Skinner brothers?~sl:0.0:3.7~Well, it's mostly bluster, as they are a bunch of fools,~sl:~but the bluster is loud, I'll grant you that.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_4 = ~z~Folk get unnecessarily scared of cannibals, in my opinion.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Anyone dumb enough to eat a feller is not to be scared of.~sl:0.7~Anyway, they get away with murder.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~They robbed some crates from a pal of mine.~sl:0.3:1.8~Them crates now need destroying,~sl:~what with discretion being the better part of valor.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~So how about you go destroy them for us?~sl:0.4~They're at a shack at Aurora Basin.

MGSEA_DS_AURO_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~And try not to get yourself served up as lunch, eh? ~sl:~I imagine it's an unpleasant experience... on the whole.

MGSEA_DS_MANZ_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~Well, that's good.~sl:0.2:4.0~As I've got something I think you'll probably enjoy.~sl:0.7:1.9~If you don't get yourselves killed.

MGSEA_DS_MANZ_2 = ~z~~sl:0.2:2.1~It's them awful Skinner Brothers again.~sl:0.4~They keep robbing a pal of mine, and... he's not a bad feller.

MGSEA_DS_MANZ_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Stealing shine of his and all sorts of nonsense, they is.~sl:0.6~He wants me to ask ya to go destroy it all for him.

MGSEA_DS_MANZ_6 = ~z~Go see what you can find out and cause some mayhem for me, eh?

MGSEA_DS_MANZ_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Should be fun. Wrestling with cannibals, trying not to get eaten...~sl:1.5:1.1~what could be better?~sl:1.5:1.7~Fun for all the family...

MGSEA_G4_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~It's different, but... I reckon you might enjoy it, you know?~sl:2.0~Have a crack.

MGSEA_INT_1 = ~z~What the fuck, buddy!

MGSEA_INT_2 = ~z~What the fuck do you want, eh?

MGSEA_INT_3 = ~z~What is it?

MGSEA_INT_4 = ~z~You want to get yourself killed or something, huh?

MGSEA_INT_5 = ~z~I don't like getting surprised.

MGSEA_INT_6 = ~z~Shit.

MGSEA_INT_12 = ~z~That type of shite, is it?

MGSEA_INT_13 = ~z~I've temporarily lost me friends, it's a fucking disaster.

MGSEA_INT_14 = ~z~I had them.

MGSEA_INT_15 = ~z~I went away for a couple of days on a killing of a...

MGSEA_INT_16 = ~z~of a bastard I owed a killing to.

MGSEA_INT_17 = ~z~Ah, good man.

MGSEA_INT_18 = ~z~And I lost the folk I ride with.

MGSEA_INT_19 = ~z~Big bunch, not like you lot.

MGSEA_INT_20 = ~z~Nah, we lived like sultans in our fucking tents.

MGSEA_INT_21 = ~z~I'll find them again, I've lost them before, ya know.

MGSEA_INT_22 = ~z~Once was for three months, it was.

MGSEA_INT_23 = ~z~That's how it goes, I guess.

MGSEA_INT_24 = ~z~Anyway, where was I?

MGSEA_INT_25 = ~z~Ah, yeah, yeah...

MGSEA_INT_26 = ~z~murder and mayhem.

MGSEA_INT_27 = ~z~Now, I don't like to kill innocent folk myself.

MGSEA_INT_28 = ~z~Gives me a real nasty feeling inside.

MGSEA_INT_29 = ~z~But these bastards, well...

MGSEA_INT_30 = ~z~I don't know how innocent these bastards are.

MGSEA_INT_31 = ~z~There's a stage, runs out of Aurora Basin.

MGSEA_INT_32 = ~z~Now, I heard a fella say it's laden with silver.

MGSEA_INT_33 = ~z~I can't rob it...

MGSEA_INT_34 = ~z~and I can't guarantee someone else isn't going to try...

MGSEA_INT_35 = ~z~but it'd be a rotten shame to let it pass by.

MGSEA_INT_36 = ~z~Anyways, on with ya's.

MGSEA_IN_CRN_1 = ~z~Well, that's good, because I reckon I've got something I wanted to discuss.

MGSEA_IN_CRN_2 = ~z~It's Colm O'Driscoll we'll be robbing.

MGSEA_IN_CRN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~The fake Irish sack of shite always has himself a few things worth robbing,~sl:0.3~and his gang, well...

MGSEA_IN_CRN_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Well, truth is, they can't fight for shit.~sl:0.4~ So we, well, you... well, you're going to rob them blind.

MGSEA_IN_CRN_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~He's taken possession of a wagon laden with booty and I...~sl:~I hear they're moving it from Strawberry to some place across West Elizabeth.

MGSEA_IN_CRN_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~So it should be ripe for the plucking.~sl:0.5:3.1~Head over there and see if you can requisition the thing from dear old Colm~sl:~and do all of us a favour.

MGSEA_IN_CRN_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~And if you see Colm, put a bullet in him and all.~sl:0.0:2.9~From a real Irishman to a pretend one.~sl:0.7~You got that?

MGSEA_IN_LMS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Good, so you ever meet Colm O'Driscoll?~sl:0.5~What a clown.

MGSEA_IN_LMS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I mean... he's not even really very Irish, but...~sl:~he gives the lot of us a bad name.

MGSEA_IN_LMS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~And a dear pal of mine hates him something proper...~sl:~and my pal, he's a proper feller.

MGSEA_IN_LMS_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~So when the opportunity to rob some of O'Driscoll's boys came in...~sl:1.3~well, I jumped at it and I reckon you will too.

MGSEA_IN_LMS_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Should be easy enough, them buggers can't fight,~sl:~and I reckon we should make a decent whack as well.

MGSEA_IN_LMS_6 = ~z~There's a coach running from Blackwater to Lone Mule Stead, find it and take it.

MGSEA_IN_LMS_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~You'll make me happy and you'll make my mentor happy,~sl:0.5:2.1~if I ever find the bastard that is...~sl:0.8~good luck now.

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_1 = ~z~Well, gainful I don't know about... but I've got something I wanted to discuss, so...

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_2 = ~z~I was out drinking the other night, right...

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_3 = ~z~And this loud mouth... you know, one of these annoying idiots talks way too much and says way too little...

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_4 = ~z~and they're calling you all manner of things.

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_5 = ~z~Was gonna put a hole in his head on account of us being friendly and all...

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_6 = ~z~But their major complaint was that... you was yellow. You know, a coward.

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_7 = ~z~That ain't something I feel qualified to discuss... just thought I'd pass it on... Yeah, he was a real annoying little bastard... I should have shot him, but I'm trying to be a good boy.

MGSEA_JB_ASN_PL_8 = ~z~Anyway, good luck to you.

MGSEA_JB_CH_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~I guessed as much...~sl:0.4:4.1~on account of you being not overly interested in the social aspects of~sl:~killing and murdering folk.

MGSEA_JB_CH_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Well, I ain't one to judge.~sl:0.6:3.4~As long as it's the right people are being killed and robbed...

MGSEA_JB_CH_3 = ~z~Well, it's really a service to society. We're just misunderstood...

MGSEA_JB_CH_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~That's what my mentor'd say, you'd like him.~sl:0.4:3.2~Yeah, folks generally do... he's got a great, uh...~sl:~moustache.

MGSEA_JB_CH_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Anyway... there's a stagecoach... another one.~sl:~Full of rich bastards with even richer bastards awaiting 'em.

MGSEA_JB_CH_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~One of them luxury ones, protected of course, but...~sl:0.3~that's nothing to a person with your proclivity.

MGSEA_JB_CH_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Where I you and not trying to better myself, morally,~sl:0.4~I'd go and kidnap the whole lot of 'em.

MGSEA_JB_CH_8 = ~z~~sl:1.0:3.0~Thing's running from New Austin to Blackwater.~sl:0.5~Good luck to you now.

MGSEA_JB_GENAC_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~I reckon that could be good for the likes of you...~sl:0.5~nothing too tough... just good times...

MGSEA_JB_GENAC_2 = ~z~Take care then.

MGSEA_JB_GENST_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Okay... well, I was just sent this.~sl:1.2~Might be interesting. Just take a look.

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~Guessed as much.~sl:0.4:2.9~By the way, did you ever meet Fineas Moss?

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Nice boy he is... fine lad...~sl:0.7~be a real shame if got himself hanged...

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_3 = ~z~It's murder he up on, murder charges.

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~It's bad because... I reckon he did do it, but...~sl:0.1:2.0~I also reckon the bastard he murdered...~sl:0.5~deserved killing.

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Well, I know this because it was his brother he murdered, and...~sl:0.6~whereas you wouldn't find a kinder feller than Fineas,

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Declan was a real sack of shit.~sl:0.5:1.8~I won't bore you with the details, but...~sl:0.6~you'd be doing me a real favor if you could save Fineas for me.

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~By the way, you haven't seen a strange bunch about?~sl:0.6~About twenty-five of them... men and women.

MGSEA_JB_JAILB_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~If you do see them...~sl:0.7~you let me know.

MGSEA_LEAVEN_01 = ~z~Time for you to go.

MGSEA_LEAVEN_03 = ~z~Be on your way.

MGSEA_LEAVEN_04 = ~z~Bye now.

MGSEA_LEAVEN_05 = ~z~So long, then.

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.0~Good. So, let me ask you a question, when is a murder not a murder?~sl:1.0~Think about it... no idea? Well I'll tell you...

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_2 = ~z~When it's an assassination. That's when.

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~So you're going to do an assassination.~sl:0.5~Nasty feller you'll be killing, but that's not the point.

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Point is, he's something in politics and some other worthy folk in politics~sl:~want him killed as that's how democracy works.

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_5 = ~z~I'm choosing to play dumb on this one, to be frank.

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~But he's some big loud-mouthed feller~sl:~that other loud-mouthed fellers couldn't beat at being loud-mouthed...

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.9~So, they had him arrested and now he's going to testify, so they want him dead...~sl:0.5~whole thing sounds bloody awful, if you ask me.

MGSEA_PAS_BLW_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~But politics is bad business,~sl:~he's being taken across the Great Plains towards Blackwater.

MGSEA_PAS_TALL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.6~Good...~sl:0.5~so you ever meet my old acquaintance Darragh from Tipperary on your travels?

MGSEA_PAS_TALL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~No? Well lucky you.~sl:0.9~Darragh from Tipperary is a total arse of a man. Not a man at all, a louse.

MGSEA_PAS_TALL_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Yes, a bloody louse~sl:~whose squealing about matters back home that are best left un-squealed about.

MGSEA_PAS_TALL_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Thus, Darragh has go. Yes, he has to go.~sl:0.9~And you're going to send him on his merry way.

MGSEA_PAS_TALL_5 = ~z~Put him six feet under where he belongs. Loud mouth bastard he is.

MGSEA_PAS_TALL_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Some bounty hunters have him and...~sl:0.2:2.7~they're taking him across Tall Trees to Blackwater.~sl:0.9~You go find 'em.
