SCSC_0789B_2 = ~z~This the real city right here... might not look like much but St. Frances is the soul.

SCSC_0789B_3 = ~z~Not the Mansion District with all those big old houses.

SCSC_0789B_4 = ~z~You won't hear music like you do round here nowhere else in the world...

SCSC_0789B_5 = ~z~ragtime, even puts rhythm in the white man.

SCSC_0789B_6 = ~z~But what do you care? Not much, I'm guessing...

SCSC_1016A_1 = ~z~You was here talking with that artist, wasn't you?

SCSC_1016B_1 = ~z~He's always in here drunk, shooting his mouth.

SCSC_1016B_2 = ~z~Vagina is art, vagina is art.

SCSC_1016B_3 = ~z~Yeah, sure buddy... not after seven kids it ain't.

SCSC_1016B_4 = ~z~All these artists are moving to St. Frances thinking they're doing us a favor...

SCSC_1016B_9 = ~z~Ah, forget it, mister... you don't care none.

SCSC_1064A_1 = ~z~You look like a country boy.

SCSC_1064B_1 = ~z~Didn't mean that in a bad way...

SCSC_1064B_2 = ~z~Ain't sure if you hunt much, but I was over in Scarlett Meadows a couple of days back...

SCSC_1064B_3 = ~z~west of an old outlaw hideout called Shady Belle... and saw a big old panther.
