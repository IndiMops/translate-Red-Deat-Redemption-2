BNP21_LETTER_3 = ~z~but I have nowhere else to turn and nobody else upon whom I can impose.

BNP21_LETTER_4 = ~z~I will, of course, pay you handsomely for your troubles.

BNP21_LETTER_5 = ~z~My family have turned quite mad and are threatening to send me away, to stop my work, which they say is disgracing them.

BNP21_LETTER_7 = ~z~Oh, I must escape, yet I am kept prisoner here. Can you help?

BNP21_LETTER_8 = ~z~Most days I am to be found at the cabins on the plantation. The main house and all it stood for are thankfully no more.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_1 = ~z~And Beau's just waiting at the station?

BNP21_RIDEBANT_2 = ~z~In the hope you'll show up? Or I'll show up to help you show up?

BNP21_RIDEBANT_3 = ~z~He goes to there every day he can... makes up some excuse or other...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_4 = ~z~I said he would see me there one day soon, and today he will. God willing.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_5 = ~z~Well, well. If he's there, that's true love alright.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_6 = ~z~I've hardly seen him since the rally, they watch me so carefully... and he's waited, or...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_7 = ~z~so his letters say... our families won't let us out...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_8 = ~z~and then all that business with Aunt Catherine and my cousins... you saw the house...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_9 = ~z~and then Leigh Gray and those boys killed... so much bloodshed...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_10 = ~z~you'd think this could be a new beginning... but everyone left alive... they're even more angry...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_11 = ~z~Maybe anger's a complicated thing to let go of...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_12 = ~z~Something good has to come out of this awful, awful feud.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_13 = ~z~That's what I been hoping.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_14 = ~z~Beau and I have to be better. Our families were here for years and years...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_15 = ~z~sometimes I feel like we can't just leave death and pain and ruination behind us.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_16 = ~z~Plenty before you have. Plenty will again.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_17 = ~z~But yeah... far as it goes, get out, don't look back, and make something decent of your lives.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_20 = ~z~He's kind, and he's caring, and he's strong...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_21 = ~z~~sl:1.0~I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean to laugh. He's a lot of things, but...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_22 = ~z~Not strong like you... but strong enough to stand up to his family.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_23 = ~z~To be different from folk. You don't know how hard that can be...

BNP21_RIDEBANT_24 = ~z~to say something is wrong, when everyone around you thinks it's right.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_25 = ~z~No, perhaps I don't. He's a good man and he's lucky... you're both lucky to have each other.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_26 = ~z~This could be the best day of my life, or the worst... I can't bear not knowing which.

BNP21_RIDEBANT_27 = ~z~Hold on. It'll be clear soon enough.

BNP21_SO_BEGIN_1 = ~z~Jewels? I knew you had some damn jewels.

BNP21_TICK_1 = ~z~Please could you buy the tickets, dear Mr. Morgan? We can't chance being seen.

BNP21_TICK_2 = ~z~Sure...

BNP21_TICK_3 = ~z~Thank you. We'll meet you on the platform.

BNP21_TRLEAVING_01 = ~z~You better catch that train.

BNP21_TRLEAVING_02 = ~z~Your train. It's leaving.

BNP21_WALKOFF_01 = ~z~Where are you going? Aren't you gonna take me there?

BNP21_WALKOFF_02 = ~z~Mr. Morgan.

BNP21_WALKOFF_03 = ~z~Mr. Morgan.
