RHRGN_BARPLR_BR_1 = ~z~Wait, you look... like... no, don't listen to me.

RHRGN_BARPLR_BR_2 = ~z~What?

RHRGN_BARPLR_BR_3 = ~z~We had some trouble here with a couple of brothers, and you just have a look of one of them. Don't mind me.

RHRGN_BARPLR_BR_4 = ~z~I'm sorry to hear that.

RHRGN_BARSICK_A_1 = ~z~Well, hello again, sir. Are you, er, feeling alright?

RHRGN_BARSICK_A_2 = ~z~Yeah, just a little tired.

RHRGN_BARSICK_A_3 = ~z~Well, nothing a stiff drink won't fix.

RHRGN_CLAY_GRY2_1 = ~z~Well, look who it is. I got a very nice sum for them Braithwaite horses...

RHRGN_CLAY_GRY2_2 = ~z~oops, did I say Braithwaite? My mistake.

RHRGN_CLAY_GRY2_3 = ~z~Not five thousand dollars, I hope?

RHRGN_CLAY_GRY2_4 = ~z~That would be telling. So you here for business or pleasure?

RHRGN_CLAY_SICK_1 = ~z~You don't look so good, Pop. Maybe it's time you retired.

RHRGN_CLAY_SICK_2 = ~z~Oh, shut up.

RHRGN_CLAY_SICK_3 = ~z~Well, how can I help you, kind sir?

RHRGN_CLIVE_01 = ~z~You alright there, Clive?

RHRGN_CLIVE_02 = ~z~Don't fall asleep again, Clive.

RHRGN_CLIVE_03 = ~z~Are you sulking again, Clive?

RHRGN_CLIVE_04 = ~z~Did you fart again, Clive?

RHRGN_CLIVE_05 = ~z~I'll feed you soon, Clive, okay?

RHRGN_CLIVE_06 = ~z~You got that funny look again.

RHRGN_CLIVE_07 = ~z~Don't glaze over on me.

RHRGN_CLIVE_08 = ~z~I didn't mean what I said about Momma, alright?

RHRGN_CLIVE_09 = ~z~Your boots on the right feet there?

RHRGN_CLIVE_10 = ~z~Stay in the present now, Clive.

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_A_1 = ~z~Finally fixed this place back up properly after a terrible shootout we had in town.

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_A_2 = ~z~Oh yeah? Sorry to hear that. Well you survived at least?

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_A_3 = ~z~Yes, just very lucky I wasn't in the store at the time.

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_A_4 = ~z~Anyway, no point dwelling in the past...

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_J_1 = ~z~Finally fixed this place back up properly after a terrible shootout we had in town.

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_J_2 = ~z~Oh yeah? Sorry to hear that. Well you survived at least?

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_J_3 = ~z~Yes, just very lucky I wasn't in the store at the time.

RHRGN_GUNGRY3_J_4 = ~z~Anyway, no point dwelling in the past...

RHRGN_GUNSICK_1 = ~z~Oh, I hardly recognized you there. You look... thinner... or something.

RHRGN_GUNSICK_2 = ~z~You remember all your customers that well, do you?

RHRGN_GUNSICK_3 = ~z~Well, I try to... I didn't mean nothing untoward by it. How can I, er, help you?

RHRGN_LIVSICK_1_2 = ~z~I'm fine, don't you worry about me.

RHRGN_LIVSICK_2_1 = ~z~Hey there, mister. You okay?

RHRGN_LIVSICK_2_2 = ~z~You don't look so good.

RHRGN_LIVSICK_2_3 = ~z~You worry about your horses, not me.

RHRGN_LIVSICK_2_4 = ~z~Alright, none of my business.

RHRGN_LIVSICK_3_1 = ~z~You, er, come down with something there, partner?

RHRGN_LIVSICK_3_2 = ~z~Some bad flu going around.

RHRGN_LIVSICK_3_3 = ~z~It's just a cough.

RHRGN_LIVSICK_3_4 = ~z~Well, unfortunately you ain't a horse so I can't help you with that. But what can I help you with?

RHRGN_PRS_FFOL1_1 = ~z~How the hell are you?

RHRGN_PRS_FFOL2_1 = ~z~Pretty good. Working on a ranch right now.

RHRGN_PRS_FFOL3_1 = ~z~Pretty good. Got some land in Great Plains. Trying to get a small ranch going.

RHRGN_PRS_FFOL4_1 = ~z~Really? Wow, good for you. Staying out of trouble then?

RHRGN_PRS_FFOL4_2 = ~z~I wouldn't go that far... but I'm trying.

RHRGN_PRS_FIRST_1 = ~z~John Marston? I don't believe it! I thought you were dead.

RHRGN_PRS_FIRST_2 = ~z~Pearson! What are you doing here?

RHRGN_PRS_FIRST_3 = ~z~~sl:1.5:3.4:1~Welcome to my store. How can I help you?

RHRGN_PRS_FIRST_4 = ~z~Are you serious?

RHRGN_PRS_FIRST_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9:1~Yeah! Beats the old butcher's table, doesn't it?

RHRGN_PRS_FIRST_6 = ~z~So what can I get for you today, sir?

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_1 = ~z~Is that him again? What does he want now?

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_2 = ~z~Him?

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_3 = ~z~He just popped in to say hello.

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_4 = ~z~You stay out of that filthy business, you hear me?

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_5 = ~z~Of course, dear.

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_6 = ~z~I overdid it on the rum and told her more than I should.

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_7 = ~z~I can still hear you!

RHRGN_PRS_FOFOL_8 = ~z~Sorry dear.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_1 = ~z~Hey, you're back! How are things?

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_2 = ~z~Not too bad.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_3 = ~z~I have to ask... do you still see any of the others?

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_4 = ~z~I left when things... well, you know how it was.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_5 = ~z~I heard about Arthur.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_6 = ~z~Yeah, that didn't end well.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_7 = ~z~I'm in touch with some of them again... Uncle, Charles, Sadie.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_8 = ~z~Really? Please send my regards, even to Mrs. Adler.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_9 = ~z~And Dutch? Is he even alive?

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_10 = ~z~I don't know. If he is, I sure hope I never lay eyes on him again.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_11 = ~z~Sad how it all turned out.

RHRGN_PRS_FORTH_12 = ~z~Anyway, no point dwelling on it now. What can I help you with today?

RHRGN_PRS_HANG1_01 = ~z~Well, I'm at a loss for words.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG1_02 = ~z~What a turn-up for the books.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG1_03 = ~z~This sure has brought the memories flooding back... not all of them good.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG1_04 = ~z~Who'd have thought it?

RHRGN_PRS_HANG1_05 = ~z~Feels like an eternity ago...

RHRGN_PRS_HANG2_01 = ~z~Well, here we are.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG2_02 = ~z~I can't say I miss not having a roof over my head.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG2_03 = ~z~You know, this really is a little awkward.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG2_04 = ~z~I try not to think too much about the... er... old days.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG2_05 = ~z~I just feel like I was a different person back then. Or a different Pearson, you might say!

RHRGN_PRS_HANG3_01 = ~z~As I say, I'm wary of too much... reminiscing. Ethel has the ears of a bat.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG3_02 = ~z~Funny to think Arthur came here with Mrs. Adler on that fateful shopping trip all those years ago.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG3_03 = ~z~So are you after anything in particular?

RHRGN_PRS_HANG3_04 = ~z~I always quite liked this area when we were here.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG3_05 = ~z~You know, sometimes people here still talk about the brutal demise of the Grays and Braithwaites. I just smile and keep quiet.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG4_01 = ~z~Anyway, in the past now.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG4_02 = ~z~Was it just a social call then, John?

RHRGN_PRS_HANG4_03 = ~z~You're a fair way out from Great Plains over this way.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG4_04 = ~z~I hate to rush you, but I should start drawing a bath for Ethel soon.

RHRGN_PRS_HANG4_05 = ~z~I don't miss slaving over a hot fire day in day out, let me tell you.

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_1 = ~z~John! Nice to see you again, how have you been?

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_2 = ~z~Not bad. You?

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_3 = ~z~Oh very well.

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_4 = ~z~So I meant to ask last time... are Abigail and Jack, er... okay? You're still with them?

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_5 = ~z~Yes, they're doing fine. Jack's nearly a young man now.

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_6 = ~z~Oh good. I'm glad to hear that. I always liked those two.

RHRGN_PRS_SECND_7 = ~z~Anyway, what can I do you for?

RHRGN_PRS_SFOL_1 = ~z~Hey, who are you talking to?

RHRGN_PRS_SFOL_2 = ~z~Just an old friend.

RHRGN_PRS_SFOL_3 = ~z~Have you tidied those shelves?

RHRGN_PRS_SFOL_4 = ~z~Yes, dear!

RHRGN_PRS_SFOL_5 = ~z~Who's that?

RHRGN_PRS_SFOL_6 = ~z~That's my wife Ethel. A wonderful woman. Changed my life...

RHRGN_PRS_TFOL_1 = ~z~Yes, dear?

RHRGN_PRS_TFOL_2 = ~z~This coffee is as bitter as wormwood!

RHRGN_PRS_TFOL_3 = ~z~Okay, I'll make a fresh pot for you. I just have a customer right now.

RHRGN_PRS_TFOL_4 = ~z~I love that woman.

RHRGN_PRS_TFOL_5 = ~z~Before her, I was married briefly to a lady called Michele, but she was an absolute nightmare.

RHRGN_PRS_TFOL_6 = ~z~Seems you've landed on your feet this time.

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_1 = ~z~Mr. Marston! I was wondering if you'd be back.

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_2 = ~z~How have you been?

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_3 = ~z~Oh ticking along. Where is it you're based now again?

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_4 = ~z~I was thinking I might send you a letter.

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_5 = ~z~Some things I wouldn't want Ethel to overhear.

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_6 = ~z~It's a place called Beecher's Hope in Great Plains, West Elizabeth.

RHRGN_PRS_THIRD_7 = ~z~Good. So what can I help you with today?

RHRGN_SAD3_AT_1 = ~z~Hey, your friend's quite a bounty hunter.

RHRGN_SAD3_AT_2 = ~z~Yeah, she's quite a deal maker too.

RHRGN_SAD3_AT_3 = ~z~Give her my regards.

RHRGN_SHADSICK_1 = ~z~Oh it's you... dropped a bit of weight there.

RHRGN_SHADSICK_2 = ~z~What do you care?

RHRGN_SHADSICK_3 = ~z~I don't... I really don't.

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_01 = ~z~Can I help you?

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_02 = ~z~You alright there?

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_03 = ~z~You need something, friend?

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_04 = ~z~You looking for anyone, partner?

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_05 = ~z~How you doing there, partner?

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_06 = ~z~Something you need, friend?

RHRGN_SHFPLAYER_07 = ~z~Everything alright, sir?

RHRGN_SHO_ASICK_1 = ~z~You're looking a little under the weather there. Is everything ok?

RHRGN_SHO_ASICK_2 = ~z~I'm alright.

RHRGN_SHO_ASICK_3 = ~z~Well, make it quick. I rather not put my own health at risk.

RHRGN_SHO_SAD1_1 = ~z~How's your friend getting on with those new clothes?

RHRGN_SHO_SAD1_2 = ~z~Not something a lady should be wearing, in my opinion, but each to their own, I suppose.

RHRGN_SHO_SAD1_3 = ~z~I'd be very surprised if you had a lady, my friend

RHRGN_SHO_SAD1_4 = ~z~Well, er, not right now... but I've had my share... Anyway...

RHRHN_ALDSICK_1 = ~z~Oh Arthur, you look terrible. What happened?

RHRHN_ALDSICK_2 = ~z~Just a little sick.

RHRHN_ALDSICK_3 = ~z~Dear oh dear. Tea with lemon, my dear boy, and lots of it. Anyway...
