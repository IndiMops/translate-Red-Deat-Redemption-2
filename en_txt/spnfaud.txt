SPNF_IG1_CALLD_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Come, please, take a pamphlet...~sl:0.1~and learn how you can save the white race.

SPNF_IG1_CALLE_1 = ~z~Read one of my pamphlets.

SPNF_IG1_CALLE_2 = ~z~I explain the exact difference between the races using real science.

SPNF_IG1_SA_1 = ~z~I want you to ask yourself... do I consider myself pure?

SPNF_IG1_SA_2 = ~z~And then I want you to ask yourself,

SPNF_IG1_SA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~what is the most disgusting, revolting,~sl:0.4~vulgar and depressing thing in all Creation?

SPNF_IG1_SA_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Mingling...~sl:1.5~co-mingling.

SPNF_IG1_SA_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~Nature... nature likes purity.~sl:0.6~Nature does not like co-mingling.

SPNF_IG1_SA_6 = ~z~Nature likes a family tree... not a family bush.

SPNF_IG1_SA_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~And this being America...~sl:0.6:4.4~and us being nature's paradise on Earth...~sl:0.6~we must push for purity.

SPNF_IG1_SA_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~I want you... I need you...~sl:0.6~to be pure.

SPNF_IG1_SB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~It ain't that white is better, or black is better...~sl:0.2~it's that purity is better.

SPNF_IG1_SB_2 = ~z~I happen to be white, as coincidence would have it...

SPNF_IG1_SB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~and am thereby capable of higher thought...~sl:0.2~but that is not the matter at hand.

SPNF_IG1_SB_4 = ~z~What I am a fan of is distinction.

SPNF_IG1_SB_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Just as some birds fly and others swim...~sl:0.3:3.2~and some cats have spots and others don't,~sl:~so it is with man.

SPNF_IG1_SB_6 = ~z~The races must be distinct in order for us to flourish.

SPNF_IG1_SB_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.5~And them that deny this is pure evil.~sl:1.1~We are not the same. And that is a fact.

SPNF_IG1_SB_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I have red blood... and a heart...~sl:1.1~and that is distinctive of the Caucasian race.

SPNF_IG1_SC_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Let's be straightforward.~sl:0.3~America is a land of sin and filth on an unimaginable scale.

SPNF_IG1_SC_2 = ~z~The whole place revolts me.

SPNF_IG1_SC_3 = ~z~It revolts all of us. It revolts us because it is unclean.

SPNF_IG1_SC_4 = ~z~Clean and pure, that's what we like. Not dirty and filthy.

SPNF_IG1_SC_5 = ~z~White and black. Not brown. Not mud.

SPNF_IG1_SC_6 = ~z~Mud is sin... and it is the worst thing for all of us.

SPNF_IG1_SC_7 = ~z~We must stay pure. Pure as science and nature intends.

SPNF_IG1_SC_8 = ~z~We are different breeds.

SPNF_IG1_SD_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Yes, all of you.~sl:1.4:3.0~Be pure. Be different.~sl:0.6~Be a different breed.

SPNF_IG1_SD_2 = ~z~Don't be a new species. A mistake. A zebra.

SPNF_IG1_SD_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~Be a lion. Yes, a lion.~sl:0.4~A pure lion.

SPNF_IG1_SD_4 = ~z~Look at Europe.

SPNF_IG1_SD_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~The pure people, the aristocrats, they rose to the top.~sl:0.8~Because they were pure.

SPNF_IG1_SD_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~They kept their family trees simple...~sl:0.2~and it has worked wonders for them.

SPNF_IG1_SD_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~If we in the New World want to challenge Europe's power...~sl:0.4~then we must be as pure as Europe and that's a fact.

SPNF_IG1_SE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.0~This century will be all about white people protecting themselves.~sl:0.2~And winning.

SPNF_IG1_SE_2 = ~z~We have given the world, a lot but now we must take from it.

SPNF_IG1_SE_3 = ~z~We must stay pure. We must stay American.

SPNF_IG1_SE_4 = ~z~We are the first Americans and we must be the last.

SPNF_IG1_SE_5 = ~z~The Indians and the Negroes should leave.

SPNF_IG1_SE_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Head west to the deserts of California or someplace...~sl:0.1~leave this pure land for us.

SPNF_IG1_SE_7 = ~z~This is what God intended and nature, too.

SPNF_IG1_SE_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~We have the wisdom.~sl:0.9~So, choose someone who looks like you... or suffer.

SPNF_IG1_SF_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~I'm not a hater.~sl:1.1~I'm a racist.

SPNF_IG1_SF_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I don't hate anybody because of what they are like.~sl:0.7~That's not kind, or Christian.

SPNF_IG1_SF_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~I hate people... because of the way they look...~sl:0.4~entirely without reference to character or personality.

SPNF_IG1_SF_4 = ~z~And I want you to, too.

SPNF_IG1_SF_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Because it's them... or us.~sl:0.6~And it is a fight to the death.

SPNF_IG1_SF_6 = ~z~Fight now, or your children will be slaves and eunuchs and that's a fact.

SPNF_IG1_SF_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~You people...~sl:1.1~do you want your sons to be a eunuch?

SPNF_IG1_SF_8 = ~z~Of course you don't. My son's not a eunuch.

SPNF_IG1_SF_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I've checked. I've checked a lot and I'll keep checking...~sl:0.2~and I think you should do the same.

SPNF_IG1_SF_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~And those of you who are not married...~sl:0.6~check that no white man is a eunuch.

SPNF_IG1_SF_11 = ~z~Because that is the future of America.

SPNF_IG1_SG_1 = ~z~I am trying to protect you all from becoming eunuchs!

SPNF_IG1_SG_2 = ~z~Think about that. Understand the science of it.

SPNF_IG1_SG_3 = ~z~Eugenics! It's the science that will save America!

SPNF_IG1_SH_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~The facts are simple.~sl:0.1~Life is war and the war is between races.

SPNF_IG1_SH_2 = ~z~If you wanna die then go ahead.

SPNF_IG1_SH_3 = ~z~But I want my race, the master race, to live forever.

SPNF_IG1_SH_4 = ~z~And I'm prepared to prove my mastery by force, if necessary.

SPNF_IG1_SH_5 = ~z~It's kill or be killed out there in nature. Always has been.

SPNF_IG1_SH_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Trees kill each other. Flowers kill each other.~sl:0.6~Even sheep kill each other.

SPNF_IG1_SH_7 = ~z~So let's stop pretending, it's time we was more like sheep.

SPNF_IG1_SH_8 = ~z~It's time to kill.

SPNF_IG1_SI_1 = ~z~It's time we all talked about purity.

SPNF_IG1_SI_2 = ~z~The impure will rule the world and then where will we be?

SPNF_IG1_SI_3 = ~z~It will be like living in a toilet.

SPNF_IG1_SJ_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Don't take my word for it... brilliant minds have agreed.~sl:~Crossbreeding will destroy us all.

SPNF_IG1_SJ_2 = ~z~Much more of this and there won't be a human race.

SPNF_IG1_SJ_3 = ~z~Monkeys will take over, or, or horses... will start talking.

SPNF_IG1_SJ_4 = ~z~~sl:0.5:3.4~I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's guaranteed...~sl:0.3~unless we keep our race pure.

SPNF_IG1_SJ_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.2~If we let people intermarry, it won't be horses pulling us.~sl:0.6~Your grandchildren... will be pulling horses.

SPNF_IG1_SJ_6 = ~z~And that's a fact, whether you like it or not.

SPNF_IG1_SK_1 = ~z~You've all got to wake up... to the truth!

SPNF_IG1_SL_1 = ~z~I'm trying to save the white race from the horrors of equality.

SPNF_IG1_SL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.5:4.3~I'm not sharing nothing with no dark-skinned folks.~sl:0.1~You do at your peril.

SPNF_IG1_SL_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Sharing is not natural...~sl:0.6~and it's not scientific and that's a fact.

SPNF_IG1_SM_1 = ~z~This is science, so do not live in ignorance.

SPNF_IG1_SM_2 = ~z~Open your minds to the hideous facts about mixing races.

SPNF_IG1_SM_3 = ~z~Your son or daughter could make you extinct.

SPNF_IG1_SM_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~If we let people mate with members of other races,~sl:0.0:1.7~then why won't people mate...~sl:0.6~with people from other species?

SPNF_IG1_SM_5 = ~z~What's the difference?

SPNF_IG1_SM_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Biologically, there is none.~sl:0.2~Your son might marry a horse.

SPNF_IG1_SM_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Your daughter might marry a duck...~sl:0.3~and...hatch her young.

SPNF_IG1_SM_8 = ~z~And trust me, that is extremely un-American.

SPNF_IG1_SN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Some of the most brilliant people...~sl:~are scientists, so you should pay attention to me.

SPNF_IG1_SN_2 = ~z~All of you, pay attention or die.

SPNF_IG1_SN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I'm talking about purity here...~sl:0.5~and nature likes nothing better than purity.

SPNF_IG1_SN_4 = ~z~Let's make America a land of thoroughbreds! Not mongrels.

SPNF_IG1_SO_1 = ~z~Nothing is more important than keeping America pure.

SPNF_IG1_SP_1 = ~z~I teach the important science of eugenics.

SPNF_IG1_SQ_1 = ~z~I want you to understand the scientific underpinnings of racism.

SPNF_IG1_SQ_2 = ~z~I want you to see that all men are not created equal.

SPNF_IG1_SQ_3 = ~z~That liberty is a lie. And there can be no happiness in this country.

SPNF_IG1_SQ_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Because I am a true patriot.~sl:0.4~A real patriot hates America.

SPNF_IG1_SR_1 = ~z~This is the science that will save the white race from extinction.

SPNF_IG1_SR_2 = ~z~And it's one hundred percent true.

SPNF_IG1_SS_1 = ~z~I've said it before and I'll say it again.

SPNF_IG1_SS_2 = ~z~I don't hate people unreasonably. I'm a fair-minded racist.

SPNF_IG2_A_1 = ~z~You sir, do you want a pamphlet?

SPNF_IG2_NEG_1 = ~z~No, you pathetic moron.

SPNF_IG2_NEG_2 = ~z~Moron? These are facts.

SPNF_IG2_NEG_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I bet you imagine a world where your grandchildren...~sl:~are subservient to monkeys.

SPNF_IG2_NEG_4 = ~z~You're pathetic.

SPNF_IG2_POS2_1 = ~z~Okay...

SPNF_IG2_POS3_1 = ~z~Read it.

SPNF_IG2_POS3_2 = ~z~It's really interesting stuff. I explain using real science.

SPNF_IG2_POS4_1 = ~z~Why we whites are under attack... and what we must do to fight back.

SPNF_IG2_POS5_1 = ~z~We're under attack?

SPNF_IG2_POS5_2 = ~z~Yes, under attack!

SPNF_IG2_POS6_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~People aren't the same, sir... I mean...~sl:0.5~white people are the same.

SPNF_IG2_POS7_1 = ~z~And all the other races are trying to kill us. I don't want to die, sir.

SPNF_IG2_POS8_1 = ~z~I got friends who's Mexican. Friends who's Indian.

SPNF_IG2_POS8_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8:1~I've known blacks, Irish, Italians... good and bad in all.

SPNF_IG2_POS9_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4:1~I've known good white people and bad white people.

SPNF_IG2_POS9_2 = ~z~And above all... dumb white people.

SPNF_IG2_POS10_1 = ~z~You sir... are a real fool.

SPNF_IG2_POS11_1 = ~z~How can you possibly believe in equality?

SPNF_IG2_POS12_1 = ~z~I've never heard such nonsense in all my natural born days.

SPNF_IG2_POS12_2 = ~z~This man believes people are equal!

SPNF_IG2_POS12_3 = ~z~Speak for yourself, sir, speak for yourself.

SPNF_IG2_POS13_1 = ~z~I'm sorry, did you just call me a fool?

SPNF_IG2_POS13_2 = ~z~A fool! A fool! A fool!

SPNF_IG2_POS13_3 = ~z~Come here!

SPNF_IG3_CALL1_1 = ~z~I-I-I... I still have pamphlets!

SPNF_IG3_CALL2_1 = ~z~Somebody take a pamphlet!

SPNF_IG3_SPEECH_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I've been here for several years now,~sl:0.2~but still this country gets worse.

SPNF_IG3_SPEECH_2 = ~z~The twentieth century must be better than the nineteenth century was...

SPNF_IG3_SPEECH_3 = ~z~but so far, Congress has failed to act.

SPNF_IG3_SPEECH_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~If this goes on...~sl:0.3:4.7:1~If we keep borders open and racial interbreeding allowed,

SPNF_IG3_SPEECH_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~within twenty years, this will be...~sl:~the worst nation on the face of the Earth...

SPNF_IG3_SPEECH_6 = ~z~~sl:0.9:0.0~and that's a fact.

SPNF_IG4_NEG1_1 = ~z~Not really.

SPNF_IG4_NEG1_2 = ~z~Then live in ignorance.

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_1 = ~z~Served me okay to this point.

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~It's thanks to people like you, that this country is such a dump.~sl:0.3~Fools, ignorant fools!

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_3 = ~z~People who accept other races as if they were our equal.

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Do you consider a dog your equal, or a horse?~sl:0.1~Of course not, then why accept a Chinaman as your equal?

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_5 = ~z~I suppose you think women are our equal!

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~You're a goddamn fool! A real fool.~sl:0.6~This man is a moron. He has a tiny brain.

SPNF_IG4_NEG2_7 = ~z~They are your equal sir, because you are a fool.

SPNF_IG4_POS_1 = ~z~I suppose so.

SPNF_IG4_POS_2 = ~z~You're making a wise choice.

SPNF_IG4_POS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~I cannot tell you how many people are happy to imagine a world...~sl:~in which their children are monkeys, or half horses...

SPNF_IG4_POS_4 = ~z~It's simply shocking. Shocking. Shocking I say.

SPNF_IG4_TAUNT1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Oh there he is, the moron.~sl:0.2~The man who is equal to a frog.

SPNF_IG4_TAUNT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~The human toad... ignore him, ladies and gentlemen,~sl:0.1~he is quite as dumb as he looks.

SPNF_IG4_TAUNT2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~Oh my, oh my, it's the moron. He's back.~sl:0.3~The man with the tiny brain.
