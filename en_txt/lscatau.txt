LS_CAT_S_COWER_3 = ~z~Now that was easy, wasn't it?

LS_CAT_THREAT_1 = ~z~I ain't your pa. I'm here for the debt he owes.

LS_CAT_TKLOOT_1 = ~z~I think I know the sum, and that should cover it.

LS_CAT_WALK2_1 = ~z~I could be fishing.

LS_CAT_WALK2_2 = ~z~You were catching flies, you weren't catching fish. Now come on, let's get us that debt.

LS_CAT_WALK2_3 = ~z~This is as fast as I can go.

LS_CAT_WALK2_R_1 = ~z~Shouldn't have borrowed no money from that shifty looking bastard.

LS_CAT_WALK2_R_2 = ~z~That's something we can both agree on. But we can also agree, you did.

LS_CAT_WALK_1 = ~z~I got a powerful thirst on me right now. How about you?

LS_CAT_WALK_2 = ~z~Or you got to be stinking drunk already to do this kind of work?

LS_CAT_WALK_3 = ~z~Oh, I like doing it sober.

LS_CAT_WALK_4 = ~z~If you'll take my money, surely you'll take a drink off'a me as well. That would be the mannerly thing to do.

LS_CAT_WALK_5 = ~z~Let's handle us the money first, worry about manners later, okay?

LS_CAT_WALK_R_1 = ~z~You're lucky I'm humouring you at all... yeah, I remember.

LS_CAT_WALK_R_2 = ~z~I don't know what you're talking about. Now, let's get that debt settled.

LS_CAT_WALK_R_3 = ~z~Hold on. You're getting it.
