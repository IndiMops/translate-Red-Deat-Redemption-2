CCTL6_ACTA1_4 = ~z~You don't know that...

CCTL6_ACTA1_5 = ~z~She told us.

CCTL6_ACTA1_6 = ~z~She was in love, she would have said anything... who knows what she did or didn't do?

CCTL6_ACTA2_1 = ~z~What do you think, Arthur?

CCTL6_ACTA2_2 = ~z~If she betrayed us, if she really did... well, it's a bad business either way, but I'm confused like both of you.

CCTL6_ACTB_1 = ~z~She had to go... its bad but...

CCTL6_ACTB_2 = ~z~Tilly, I do believe you've got a cold heart.

CCTL6_ACTB_4 = ~z~Of course it ain't, but I'm scared.

CCTL6_ACTB_5 = ~z~Me too... me too....
