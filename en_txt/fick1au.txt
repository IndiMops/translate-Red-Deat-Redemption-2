CAKIE_FSH2_1 = ~z~You going fishing?

CAKIE_FSH2_2 = ~z~Yes.

CAKIE_FSH2_3 = ~z~Or running off to Colm O'Driscoll?

CAKIE_FSH2_4 = ~z~Of course not.

CAKIE_FSH2_5 = ~z~I was joking.

CAKIE_FSH2_6 = ~z~That's very funny...

CAKIE_FSH2_7 = ~z~yes, very-very funny.

CAKIE_FSH2_8 = ~z~I saved your life...

CAKIE_FSH2_9 = ~z~and now you torture me. Ho ho ho.

CAKIE_FSH2_10 = ~z~Shut up.

CAKIE_FSH2_11 = ~z~Do you wanna go fishing with me?

CAKIE_FSH2_12 = ~z~I-I've found an interesting spot, we'll do well.

CAKIE_FSH2_13 = ~z~I'm not a great fisherman.

CAKIE_FSH2_14 = ~z~But I am...

CAKIE_FSH2_15 = ~z~I'll teach you something.

CAKIE_FSH2_16 = ~z~Will you come?

CAKIE_FSH2_17 = ~z~Sure.

CAKIE_FSH2_LI_1 = ~z~Arthur.

FICK1_IG1_1 = ~z~This is the place, some beautiful smallmouth here.

FICK1_IG1_2 = ~z~Bass?

FICK1_IG1_3 = ~z~Sure.

FICK1_IG2_1 = ~z~Is that why you like this spot?

FICK1_IG2_2 = ~z~My Lord... there's somebody who needs to go to confession.

FICK1_IG3_1 = ~z~Did you see that amazing bluegill?

FICK1_IG3_2 = ~z~Sure!

FSH_KIE_ABAND1_1 = ~z~Hey! What's wrong? What are you doing?

FSH_KIE_ABAND2_1 = ~z~Where are you going?

FSH_KIE_ABAND3_1 = ~z~Hey, don't tell me you're done already?

FSH_KIE_ARCTCH_01 = ~z~There you go!

FSH_KIE_ARCTCH_02 = ~z~Keep it coming, but carefully.

FSH_KIE_ARCTCH_03 = ~z~Not too fast, you could break the line.

FSH_KIE_CAST2_01 = ~z~Cast one in then, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_CAST2_02 = ~z~Get after that bluegill, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_CAST2_03 = ~z~You won't catch much if you don't cast a line.

FSH_KIE_CAST_01 = ~z~Cast a line then, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_CAST_02 = ~z~Why aren't you fishing?

FSH_KIE_CAST_03 = ~z~Are you giving up on me already?

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_1 = ~z~You getting many bites there, O'Driscoll?

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_2 = ~z~I ain't an O'Driscoll! I told you fellers a hundred times.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_3 = ~z~I'd only been with them a couple of months.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_4 = ~z~I was just a runner, helping out with the horses mainly.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_5 = ~z~Bottom rung of the ladder.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_6 = ~z~And to think that was the high point of your career.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_7 = ~z~Colm goes through men like cigars. They ain't like you folks...

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_8 = ~z~He barely knew my name.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_9 = ~z~I'm more Kieran van der Linde than Kieran O'Driscoll at this point, honest to God...

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_10 = ~z~but mostly I'm Kieran Duffy.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_1_11 = ~z~I hate to break it to you but I ain't sure Kieran van der Linde is going to stick...

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_1 = ~z~So you think Dutch trusts me now?

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_2 = ~z~That's a good one.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_3 = ~z~What?

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_4 = ~z~Not in the slightest, my friend.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_5 = ~z~I can't win. I promise loyalty, he says “but you wasn't loyal to Colm”...

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_6 = ~z~if I say I got no allegiance to nobody, he says

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_7 = ~z~“how do I know you won't turn on us, then?”

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_8 = ~z~I don't know what you want to hear.

FSH_KIE_CHAT1_2_9 = ~z~I'm trying hard to feel sorry for you, but somehow, I just can't manage to.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_1_1 = ~z~So, who taught you how to fish?

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_1_2 = ~z~My pappy, mostly. I lost my mammy and pappy when I was young, to cholera.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_1_3 = ~z~Your mammy?

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_1_4 = ~z~Like I said, I was real young. After that, I was on my own pretty much.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_1_5 = ~z~But I knew horses and fishing.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_1_6 = ~z~Well, just think now, you'll never be alone again.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_1 = ~z~See, look at this. Life ain't so bad. Least you ain't tied to a tree.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_2 = ~z~I'm still a prisoner, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_3 = ~z~I can't step outside camp by myself for a second

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_4 = ~z~without being terrified one of Colm's boys is gonna pick me up.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_5 = ~z~When I'm in camp, I got Bill and Sadie

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_6 = ~z~whispering in my ear all the time, how they're gonna kill me in my sleep.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_7 = ~z~It's like living in a nightmare.

FSH_KIE_CHAT2_2_8 = ~z~Christ. If I'd know you were going to moan this much, I'd never have said yes to this.

FSH_KIE_CLOSE_01 = ~z~Hey, careful, I don't want to hook you, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_CLOSE_02 = ~z~Well, er, I think we could spread out a little bit.

FSH_KIE_CLOSE_03 = ~z~That's a little close, ain't it, Arthur?

FSH_KIE_CLOSE_04 = ~z~Whoa, you're right up on me there, huh?

FSH_KIE_CNGRT1_1 = ~z~Nice. Good catch, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_CTRP_01_1 = ~z~Did you hook him? The big one?

FSH_KIE_CTRP_01_2 = ~z~I don't know, it don't feel like much of a fighter.

FSH_KIE_CTRP_02_1 = ~z~You got it. That has got to be the one, right?

FSH_KIE_CTRP_02_2 = ~z~No, don't feel very big to me.

FSH_KIE_CTRP_03_1 = ~z~I bet you got the big one there!

FSH_KIE_CTRP_03_2 = ~z~Hard to say, feels pretty light.

FSH_KIE_CTRP_04_1 = ~z~Did you hook him? The big one?

FSH_KIE_CTRP_04_2 = ~z~Hard to say... whatever it is, it's putting up a good fight.

FSH_KIE_CTRP_05_1 = ~z~You got it. That has got to be the one, right?

FSH_KIE_CTRP_05_2 = ~z~It might be, it's putting up one hell of a fight.

FSH_KIE_CTRP_06_1 = ~z~I bet you got the big one there!

FSH_KIE_CTRP_06_2 = ~z~Not sure, but he feels big!

FSH_KIE_DEPART_1 = ~z~Okay, follow me.

FSH_KIE_DEPART_2 = ~z~I know a great little fishing spot along the beach.

FSH_KIE_DISM_2_1 = ~z~Come on Arthur, lets walk down to the beach.

FSH_KIE_EXCITED_1 = ~z~That got you real excited, huh?

FSH_KIE_FAR2_1 = ~z~I think you'll have more luck closer to me here.

FSH_KIE_FAR_1 = ~z~You don't have to stand that far away, I don't smell that bad.

FSH_KIE_FBAIT_1 = ~z~Seeing lots of Bluegill and Bass over here.

FSH_KIE_FBAIT_2 = ~z~Bait with worms or crickets if you got them.

FSH_KIE_FBAIT_3 = ~z~Otherwise, maybe some bread or cheese.

FSH_KIE_FISH_1 = ~z~This strip of shore looks perfect, pick a spot.

FSH_KIE_FOLLOW_1 = ~z~I know where that is. Come on, let's go!

FSH_KIE_HURRY_01 = ~z~Are you coming, then?

FSH_KIE_HURRY_02 = ~z~Don't tell me you changed your mind?

FSH_KIE_HURRY_03 = ~z~I'm ready when you are.

FSH_KIE_LC2_CTH_1 = ~z~Is it that monster?

FSH_KIE_LC2_CTH_2 = ~z~Did you get it?

FSH_KIE_LC2_CTH_3 = ~z~Not sure. It's a fighter, whatever it is.

FSH_KIE_LC2_CTH_4 = ~z~Let's see if I can reel him in.

FSH_KIE_LGDFAIL_1 = ~z~It's too big to catch.

FSH_KIE_LGDFAIL_2 = ~z~I reckon we should call it a day.

FSH_KIE_LGDFAIL_3 = ~z~I'm going to head back to camp, Arthur, if that's okay?

FSH_KIE_LGDFAIL_4 = ~z~Sure, go on.

FSH_KIE_LGDFSH2_1 = ~z~Sure wish I was the one to catch it.

FSH_KIE_LGDFSH2_2 = ~z~Well you ain't known for your luck, Kieran.

FSH_KIE_LGDFSH2_3 = ~z~Well, guess I'll head back to camp now. Good job, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_LGDFSH2_4 = ~z~Alright then. See you later.

FSH_KIE_LGDFSH_1 = ~z~You got it! Amazing!

FSH_KIE_LOC02C_1 = ~z~I hope we land this monster.

FSH_KIE_LOC02C_2 = ~z~Uh huh.

FSH_KIE_LOC02C_3 = ~z~It ain't easy to catch a fish like that with bread and cheese, but you never know.

FSH_KIE_LOC02C_4 = ~z~We might get lucky.

FSH_KIE_LOC02C_5 = ~z~Guess we'll see.

FSH_KIE_LOST1_1 = ~z~Oh, too bad!  Maybe next time.

FSH_KIE_LTSGO2_1 = ~z~Let's try our luck somewhere else. I know another spot where hopefully we won't be interrupted.

FSH_KIE_LTSGO2_2 = ~z~Sounds perfect for the drowning.

FSH_KIE_LTSGO2_3 = ~z~Er, very funny.

FSH_KIE_LTSGO_1 = ~z~Come on. Let's go.

FSH_KIE_LV_BRBA_1 = ~z~I don't think we have much chance, we need better bait.

FSH_KIE_LV_BRBA_2 = ~z~You might want to see if the stores round here sell anything better.

FSH_KIE_LV_BRBA_3 = ~z~I think I'm going to head back to camp, Arthur, if that's okay?

FSH_KIE_LV_BRBA_4 = ~z~Sure, go on. I'll see you later.

FSH_KIE_LV_BTRB_1 = ~z~I don't have a chance in hell with my bait.

FSH_KIE_LV_BTRB_2 = ~z~I'm going to head back to camp to see if I can find something better.

FSH_KIE_LV_BTRB_3 = ~z~You keep trying, though.

FSH_KIE_LV_BTRB_4 = ~z~Okay, make sure you go straight back there.

FSH_KIE_LV_SCR1_1 = ~z~Where you going?

FSH_KIE_LV_SCR1_2 = ~z~What's wrong? That big fish didn't scare you off, did it?

FSH_KIE_LV_WRNG_1 = ~z~I don't think we got much chance here, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_LV_WRNG_2 = ~z~I reckon I'm going to head back to camp, if that's okay?

FSH_KIE_LV_WRNG_3 = ~z~Sure, go on. I'll see you later.

FSH_KIE_MOUNT_1 = ~z~Alright then, grab your horse and let's go.

FSH_KIE_NLEGND_01 = ~z~Nope, not the big one. Let's keep trying.

FSH_KIE_NLEGND_02 = ~z~Nice catch, but that's not the big one we saw.

FSH_KIE_NLEGND_03 = ~z~Not bad, but it ain't the one we saw jump out of the water.

FSH_KIE_NOTIT_1 = ~z~No, that's not it.

FSH_KIE_REELNG2_1 = ~z~Whoa, it sure is a fighter!

FSH_KIE_REELNG2_2 = ~z~It has to be the big one!

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_1 = ~z~Who'd've thought it?

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_2 = ~z~Wasn't that long ago I was tied to the back of your horse while begging for mercy.

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_3 = ~z~Now we're off fishing together.

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_4 = ~z~How do you know I ain't just looking for a good place to drown you?

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_5 = ~z~Because I saved your life, Arthur.

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_6 = ~z~You keep saying that.

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_7 = ~z~But I save your life every day I don't kill you,

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_8 = ~z~so we are more than even on that front.

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_9 = ~z~Come on. You don't mean that?

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_10 = ~z~You better believe I mean it, now where's this spot?

FSH_KIE_RIDE_01_11 = ~z~Not much further.

FSH_KIE_ROD2_1 = ~z~What are you waiting for?

FSH_KIE_ROD_1 = ~z~Get your rod out then, Arthur, before I catch them all.

FSH_KIE_SPOT2_1 = ~z~I've been meaning to try this spot out.

FSH_KIE_SPOT_1 = ~z~I think this is the place that naked feller was talking about.

FSH_KIE_SWMER_1 = ~z~What in the world?

FSH_KIE_SWMER_2 = ~z~Arthur, are you seeing this? Feller's naked as a jaybird.

FSH_KIE_TRYAGN_1 = ~z~Now see if you can hook another.

FSH_KIE_WAITUP_1 = ~z~Hey, wait up!
