963_AB_BCH_NEG_1 = ~z~Hey, come on, I ain't even got into it yet.

963_AB_BCH_POS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.9:0.0~I had a feeling this'd interest you.

963_A_1 = ~z~~sl:1.1:0.0~Keep telling myself I'll strike it rich one of these days, but that day's sure dragging its heel. Believe you me.

963_A_2 = ~z~Can't tell you how much time I wasted chasing treasure...

963_A_3 = ~z~Spent a few weeks down around the town of Rhodes recently, don't know if you ever passed through it though.

963_A_4 = ~z~Feller told me about these two old plantation families there, how...

963_A_5 = ~z~how they had this serious falling out, how one of them had hidden a big old pile of gold somewhere.

963_BC_BCH_NEG_1 = ~z~Why would I lie about this?

963_BC_BCH_POS_1 = ~z~Yeah, I really thought I was onto it.

963_B_1 = ~z~I mean, I thought what better way to find my fortune than on the slavers' filthy dollar, you understand?

963_B_2 = ~z~Not that I expect you to understand that.

963_B_3 = ~z~Thought I was onto something too.

963_B_4 = ~z~One of their maids had showed me this old carving that said "Where the death adder spits"

963_B_5 = ~z~and then I spot this place called Copperhead Landing on my map and put two and two together...

963_CD_BCH_NEG_1 = ~z~Alright, okay. If you don't want to hear, I ain't gonna waste no more breath.

963_C_1 = ~z~I spent days around there digging up ground from dawn 'tll dusk,

963_C_2 = ~z~but found nothing but an old pair of boots I'm wearing right now.

963_C_3 = ~z~But maybe that's all the riches a man like me need.

963_D_1 = ~z~Yeah... the land gives all we need and more. The rest of it...

963_D_2 = ~z~well, I... I'm starting to realize perhaps there's such a thing as easy money for fellers like you and me.

963_D_3 = ~z~Though I can't stop thinking I must have missed something...

963_D_4 = ~z~Anyway, it's done now.

963_EXIT_DAY_1 = ~z~Well, thanks for listening. You know, I can't sit around here all day.

963_INTRO_1 = ~z~Gets rough out here sometimes, don't it?

963_INTRO_NEG_1 = ~z~Dunno, you tell me.

963_INTRO_NEG_J_1 = ~z~Dunno, you tell me.

963_INTRO_POS_1 = ~z~Sure does.

963_INTRO_POS_J_1 = ~z~Sure does.
