REVEN_HOLDGUN3_02 = ~z~You hold still or you're done.

REVEN_HOLDGUN3_03 = ~z~You best make like a statue!

REVEN_HOLDGUN3_04 = ~z~I don't want to see you so much as twitch!

REVEN_HOLDGUN3_05 = ~z~You want to die? You move, you get your wish.

REVEN_HOLDGUN4_01 = ~z~Hold still. I got no problem killing you.

REVEN_HOLDGUN4_02 = ~z~Don't you move. Not an inch.

REVEN_HOLDGUN4_03 = ~z~Stay put, hear me?

REVEN_HOLDMKN2_05 = ~z~Not much of a team in the end.

REVEN_HOLDMKN3_01 = ~z~Well, maybe they'll hang all y'all together. That'd be nice.

REVEN_HOLDMKN3_02 = ~z~Nice of you to all come together.

REVEN_HOLDMKN3_03 = ~z~I expected more from y'all, if I'm honest.
