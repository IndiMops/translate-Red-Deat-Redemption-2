SPCWC_IG1_INTRO_1 = ~z~State your side, sir. North or South?

SPCWC_IG1_NEG_1 = ~z~What the hell you talking about, old man?

SPCWC_IG1_NEG_2 = ~z~I know one when I see one.

SPCWC_IG1_POS_1 = ~z~Well, I sure ain't from the south.

SPCWC_IG1_POS_2 = ~z~Lucky for you.

SPCWC_IG1_POS_3 = ~z~Captain Hayden Russell, 29th Ambarino Volunteer Infantry. Do you bring news from General Scollick?

SPCWC_IG1_POS_4 = ~z~Who's General Scollick?

SPCWC_IG1_POS_5 = ~z~I'm awaiting orders. We will move on Lemoyne soon and take Saint Denis from the rebels.

SPCWC_IG1_POS_6 = ~z~You do know what year it is, right?

SPCWC_IG1_POS_7 = ~z~What kind of question's that? 1862... April 14th.

SPCWC_IG1_POS_8 = ~z~Now move along, civilian, and watch yourself. Johnny Rebs in the area.

SPCWC_IG1_SHOOT_1 = ~z~Alright then!

SPCWC_IG1_WARN1_1 = ~z~State your side, or I'll shoot!

SPCWC_IG1_WARN2_1 = ~z~Last warning.

SPCWC_IG2_INTRO_1 = ~z~North or South? State your side, sir.

SPCWC_IG2_NEG_1 = ~z~Ain't we been through this before?

SPCWC_IG2_NEG_2 = ~z~Don't play games with me.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_1 = ~z~I ain't no southerner, if that's what you're worried about.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_2 = ~z~I am worried, very worried indeed.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_3 = ~z~Captain Hayden Russell, 29th Ambarino Volunteer Infantry.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_4 = ~z~We've met before, you know.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_5 = ~z~I never laid eyes on you in my life.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_6 = ~z~Been stationed here a while, we should be pushing down into Lemoyne soon.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_7 = ~z~Communication's been slow and difficult, but like General Scollick says, a good soldier knows how to wait.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_8 = ~z~You've certainly done that.

SPCWC_IG2_POS_9 = ~z~Well, I... can't be caught nattering to civilians, I have a post to guard.

SPCWC_IG2_SHOOT_1 = ~z~Damn snake!

SPCWC_IG2_WARN1_1 = ~z~Are you a Northerner?

SPCWC_IG2_WARN2_1 = ~z~I won't ask again.

SPCWC_IG3_INTRO_1 = ~z~Are you with the Union?

SPCWC_IG3_NEG1_1 = ~z~Nobody's with the Union no more, you're the only one.

SPCWC_IG3_NEG2_1 = ~z~Sneaking up on me.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_1 = ~z~I guess so.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_2 = ~z~You guess so? You're a civilian?

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_3 = ~z~Of sorts. You don't remember me at all do you?

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_4 = ~z~I've never met you.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_5 = ~z~But I must say, an able-bodied man not signing up, that's a damn shame.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_6 = ~z~It's been a hard war, a long war.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_7 = ~z~Very long, in your case.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_8 = ~z~Now, we're moving on Lemoyne soon, I'm just waiting for word from General Scollick.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_9 = ~z~There's been some activity on the telegraph, so I'm sure it's any day now.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_10 = ~z~And until then?

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_11 = ~z~I keep my uniform washed, my boots polished, my rifle clean.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_12 = ~z~You don't need to be stuck out here no more.

SPCWC_IG3_POS1_13 = ~z~Do you want me to take you to the nearest town?

SPCWC_IG3_POS2_1 = ~z~A soldier never leaves his post. Not that I can expect you to understand that.

SPCWC_IG3_POS2_2 = ~z~Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the inspection of arms.

SPCWC_IG3_SHOOT_1 = ~z~You had your chance!

SPCWC_IG3_WARN1_1 = ~z~Talk, boy, Union or Confederate?

SPCWC_IG3_WARN2_1 = ~z~I will shoot, don't think I won't.

SPCWC_IG4_INTRO_1 = ~z~Are you with the Union army?

SPCWC_IG4_NEG1_1 = ~z~Is this a joke? Put that gun down, old man.

SPCWC_IG4_NEG2_1 = ~z~Nice try!

SPCWC_IG4_POS1_1 = ~z~Uh... I suppose so.

SPCWC_IG4_POS1_2 = ~z~You suppose so? Why aren't you in uniform?

SPCWC_IG4_POS1_3 = ~z~I ain't a soldier.

SPCWC_IG4_POS1_4 = ~z~Is that right?

SPCWC_IG4_POS1_5 = ~z~Captain Hayden Russell, 29th Ambarino Volunteer Infantry.

SPCWC_IG4_POS1_6 = ~z~What are you doing out here?

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_1 = ~z~Awaiting orders. We will muster soon and move on Lemoyne, to take Saint Denis from the rebels!

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_2 = ~z~What year do you think it is?

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_3 = ~z~Oh, my boy, I haven't been out here that long, 1862, April 14th.

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_4 = ~z~I must say, a young man like you, neither volunteered nor drafted? You must be a coward, or rich, or both.

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_5 = ~z~Crazy old man...

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_6 = ~z~You should have a little more respect for the men in service.

SPCWC_IG4_POS2_7 = ~z~I will ask you to move along.

SPCWC_IG4_SHOOT_1 = ~z~You think you can trick me?

SPCWC_IG4_WARN1_1 = ~z~Are you a Northerner?

SPCWC_IG4_WARN2_1 = ~z~I'll shoot you if I have to.

SPCWC_IG5_INTRO_1 = ~z~You there! State your side. Gray or blue?

SPCWC_IG5_NEG_1 = ~z~I don't have to answer to you, you crazy old bastard.

SPCWC_IG5_NEG_2 = ~z~Then answer to this!

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_1 = ~z~I don't have a side.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_2 = ~z~Oh god, don't tell me you're a Delaware boy.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_3 = ~z~No. Look, we've met before.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_4 = ~z~No, you must have me mistaken with someone else.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_5 = ~z~Captain Hayden Russell, 29th Ambarino Volunteer Infantry.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_6 = ~z~You must have been out here... fourty odd years.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_7 = ~z~Well, don't exaggerate my boy.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_8 = ~z~It has been a long and bloody war, and communication has been slow, but nobody said it was gonna be easy.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_9 = ~z~Having to leave my sweet Muriel behind... a farm boy, without a lick of training... straight into battle.

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_10 = ~z~She your wife?

SPCWC_IG5_POS1_11 = ~z~My betrothed.

SPCWC_IG5_POS2_1 = ~z~Just go. She may still be out there.

SPCWC_IG5_POS2_2 = ~z~I damn well hope she is. She said she'd wait and I saved up for a year to buy that ring.

SPCWC_IG5_POS2_3 = ~z~But a soldier doesn't desert his post. I'm expecting a missive from General Scollick any day now.

SPCWC_IG5_POS2_4 = ~z~We're gonna move on Lemoyne and take Saint Denis from the rebels.

SPCWC_IG5_POS2_5 = ~z~Okay.

SPCWC_IG5_POS2_6 = ~z~In the meantime, I have weapons to clean and boots to polish. So I will bid you farewell.

SPCWC_IG5_SHOOT_1 = ~z~Rebel scum!

SPCWC_IG5_WARN1_1 = ~z~State your side!

SPCWC_IG5_WARN2_1 = ~z~I'm giving you two more seconds.
