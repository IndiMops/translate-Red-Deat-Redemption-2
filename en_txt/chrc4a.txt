CHRC4_A1B_1 = ~z~I figured we'd take up position behind these rocks.

CHRC4_A1B_2 = ~z~Yep, seems good.

CHRC4_A1_1 = ~z~Let's leave the horses off the road to the right here.

CHRC4_A2_1 = ~z~The stage should be coming up the river from Catfish Jacksons any time now.

CHRC4_COVERDAWD_01 = ~z~Quick, it'll be here any minute.

CHRC4_COVERDAWD_02 = ~z~What are you doing? They'll spot you.

CHRC4_COVERDAWD_03 = ~z~Come on, Arthur, get behind these rocks.

CHRC4_EXT_1 = ~z~You alive?

CHRC4_EXT_2 = ~z~Yeah...

CHRC4_EXT_3 = ~z~are you?

CHRC4_EXT_4 = ~z~Evidently.

CHRC4_EXT_5 = ~z~That was not the way I was expecting things to go.

CHRC4_EXT_6 = ~z~You took us into a trap.

CHRC4_EXT_7 = ~z~Look...

CHRC4_EXT_8 = ~z~I'm telling you...

CHRC4_EXT_9 = ~z~it was good information.

CHRC4_EXT_10 = ~z~Wait.

CHRC4_EXT_11 = ~z~Look.

CHRC4_EXT_12 = ~z~Well, there's some money here.

CHRC4_EXT_13 = ~z~Not much...

CHRC4_EXT_14 = ~z~Yeah, it ain't much...

CHRC4_EXT_15 = ~z~'cause it was a trap.

CHRC4_EXT_16 = ~z~Stage companies do this all the time.

CHRC4_EXT_17 = ~z~They set up traps...

CHRC4_EXT_18 = ~z~to catch fools...~n~~m~Aww shit.

CHRC4_EXT_19 = ~z~like you and me.

CHRC4_EXT_20 = ~z~I feel like a fool.

CHRC4_EXT_21 = ~z~Well, that's good, 'cause you are a fool...

CHRC4_EXT_22 = ~z~but you're still alive, so...

CHRC4_EXT_23 = ~z~don't worry too much about it.

CHRC4_EXT_24 = ~z~Go on, get out of here before any more turn up.

CHRC4_EXT_25 = ~z~Alright, see you back at camp.

CHRC4_H1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.3~Seems like only yesterday, you and me was shooting our way in here to rob those fools.

CHRC4_H1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.3~Yeah, I know.

CHRC4_H1_3 = ~z~I'll be glad to leave this place behind, if I'm honest. Got a bad feel to it.

CHRC4_H1_4 = ~z~Least it's got a roof.

CHRC4_H1_5 = ~z~You've got a roof. 'Course, I'm outside with the juniors.

CHRC4_H1_6 = ~z~~sl:0.2~You ain't even twenty years old... your time'll come.

CHRC4_IG1_1 = ~z~There it is...

CHRC4_IG1_2 = ~z~And I don't see no escorts, neither. This should be a cakewalk.

CHRC4_IG1_3 = ~z~You sure about that?

CHRC4_IG1_4 = ~z~You see any? Soon as they're close enough, we'll jump out... hit 'em fast.

CHRC4_IG1_5 = ~z~Just wait for my lead, okay?

CHRC4_IG1_6 = ~z~I said wait for my lead!

CHRC4_IG2_1 = ~z~This is a robbery! Drop your weapon and put your hands in the air!

CHRC4_IG2_2 = ~z~I said drop the weapon!

CHRC4_IG2_3 = ~z~Okay, okay, just take it easy, alright boy?

CHRC4_IG2_4 = ~z~Anyone else? Anyone inside there?

CHRC4_IG2_5 = ~z~Answer me!

CHRC4_IG2_6 = ~z~Last chance. Come out or we're coming in!

CHRC4_IG2_7 = ~z~U.S. Marshals! You're under arrest!

CHRC4_INT_1 = ~z~Nothing.

CHRC4_INT_2 = ~z~I don't believe you.

CHRC4_INT_3 = ~z~Just a little robbery, alright, nothing serious.

CHRC4_INT_4 = ~z~Good...

CHRC4_INT_5 = ~z~what you robbing?

CHRC4_INT_6 = ~z~A stage.

CHRC4_INT_7 = ~z~There's a stage coming through.

CHRC4_INT_8 = ~z~According to the feller I met, it'll have a bunch of money aboard...

CHRC4_INT_9 = ~z~and no security whatsoever as it comes up the...

CHRC4_INT_10 = ~z~river trail between here and Catfish Jacksons.

CHRC4_INT_11 = ~z~Okay...

CHRC4_INT_12 = ~z~sounds worth investigating.

CHRC4_INT_13 = ~z~You and who?

CHRC4_INT_14 = ~z~I don't know...

CHRC4_INT_15 = ~z~I thought I'd do it on my own.

CHRC4_INT_16 = ~z~It'll be unprotected.

CHRC4_INT_17 = ~z~Won't be a huge take but...

CHRC4_INT_18 = ~z~I should make out okay.

CHRC4_INT_19 = ~z~There ain't no such thing as unprotected.

CHRC4_INT_20 = ~z~Now...

CHRC4_INT_21 = ~z~who you want to go with?

CHRC4_INT_22 = ~z~I guess you.

CHRC4_INT_23 = ~z~Now?

CHRC4_INT_24 = ~z~I don't need no hand holding, Arthur.

CHRC4_INT_25 = ~z~Aw, come on, kid.

CHRC4_INT_26 = ~z~But if we decide to do it, once we've had a look...

CHRC4_INT_27 = ~z~I'm taking half the money.

CHRC4_INT_LI_1 = ~z~What you doing?

CHRC4_INT_LI_GT_1 = ~z~Hey, Arthur.

CHRC4_LENRUN_1 = ~z~Shit!

CHRC4_MARAGGRO_1 = ~z~You boys thought you could just keep robbing every coach that came through?

CHRC4_MOUNTUP_01 = ~z~Are you coming then?

CHRC4_MOUNTUP_02 = ~z~Mount up, Arthur, we need to go.

CHRC4_MOUNTUP_03 = ~z~Come on. We're gonna miss it if we don't leave now.

CHRC4_P1_1 = ~z~Alright, let's get going then. It should be on its way right now.

CHRC4_P2_1 = ~z~Follow me. I saw a good spot for an ambush.

CHRC4_P3_1 = ~z~So who's the feller who told you about this?

CHRC4_P3_2 = ~z~It's a sound lead, I told you.

CHRC4_P3_3 = ~z~And what did he have to gain by giving you this information?

CHRC4_P3_4 = ~z~You mean did I give him money or a gun?

CHRC4_P3_5 = ~z~You're just gonna have to trust me on this one, Arthur.

CHRC4_P3_6 = ~z~Okay, okay, I do.

CHRC4_P3_7 = ~z~You've more than proved yourself the past six months.

CHRC4_P3_8 = ~z~Don't forget I was on the run for murder before falling in with you boys.

CHRC4_P3_9 = ~z~For three years. ~rp~It ain't like I'm new to any of this.

CHRC4_P3_10 = ~z~Those fellers who killed your pa?

CHRC4_P3_11 = ~z~Yep, and I'd do it again right now.

CHRC4_P3_12 = ~z~Of course.

CHRC4_P4_1 = ~z~Okay, here we are.
