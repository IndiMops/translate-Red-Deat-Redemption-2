FUD1DEPSTART01_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Load Anders onto the back of your horse there...~sl:~and we'll take him to Sheriff Gray.

FUD1DEPSTART03_01 = ~z~Come on, I assume you're not walking him in.

FUD1DEPSTART03_02 = ~z~Put him on your horse and let's go.

FUD1FISHARRIVE_1 = ~z~This is the spot, down to the left there.

FUD1FISHCATCHN_01 = ~z~Come on, Arthur, you can't go back empty-handed.

FUD1FISHCATCHN_02 = ~z~Arthur, you have to catch one at least.

FUD1FISHCATCHN_03 = ~z~Maybe if you caught a fish, we'd stop teasing you.

FUD1FISHCATCHR_1 = ~z~Got one.

FUD1FISHCATCHR_2 = ~z~Not bad.

FUD1FISHCATCH_1 = ~z~Alright, think we got a decent haul here. Pearson will be happy. Should we head back?

FUD1FISHCATCH_2 = ~z~We could keep the boat, not too far back to camp from here.

FUD1FISHCATCH_3 = ~z~Good idea, could be useful.

FUD1FISHCATCH_4 = ~z~What about the horses?

FUD1FISHCATCH_5 = ~z~Oh, they'll find their way back.

FUD1FISHCATCH_6 = ~z~Just follow the shore south, Arthur.

FUD1FISHLURE_1 = ~z~Are you trying to make your lure look like a dead fish?

FUD1FISHLURE_2 = ~z~They won't be interested if it ain't moving.

FUD1FISHRIDE_1 = ~z~Alright, gentlemen, follow me.

FUD1FISHSTART_1 = ~z~Alright, good luck gentlemen.

FUD1FOLLDUTCH_01 = ~z~Come on, let's get out of here for a bit.

FUD1FOLLDUTCH_04 = ~z~Let's go. You need some recreation, my boy.

FUD1LAKEEND_1 = ~z~I think here's good.

FUD1LAKESTART2_01 = ~z~Keep going.

FUD1LAKESTART2_02 = ~z~Head towards the middle of the lake.

FUD1LAKESTART2_03 = ~z~Get us a bit deeper.

FUD1RHOARRIVE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Okay, we're gonna stop just ahead on the right,~sl:~outside the Sheriff's office.

FUD1RHOARRIVE3R_01 = ~z~Sooner you get him off your horse, sooner we can get him in a cell.

FUD1RHOARRIVE3R_02 = ~z~Chop chop, don't just leave him slumped on there for the whole town to see.

FUD1RHOARRIVE3R_03 = ~z~Come on, partner, before he wakes up.

FUD1RHOARRIVE3_1 = ~z~Can you grab Anders off your horse and carry him in for me?

FUD1RHOARRIVE4_1 = ~z~Hey, fellers.

FUD1RHOARRIVE5R_01 = ~z~Okay, this way.

FUD1RHOARRIVE5R_02 = ~z~Bring him in so we can show Sheriff Gray.

FUD1RHOARRIVE5R_03 = ~z~Carry him over then.

FUD1RHOARRIVE5R_04 = ~z~Just bring him here.

FUD1RHOTALK_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Arthur, you start sniffing around the Grays' place,~sl:~see what the story is there.

FUD1RHOTALK_3 = ~z~Yeah, I passed by it earlier with our friend Archibald.

FUD1RHOTALK_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Good. Hosea,~sl:~you see what you can find out about these Braithwaites.

FUD1RHOTALK_5 = ~z~Alright.

FUD1_ACTAJ_1 = ~z~Alright, alright, this ain't a race.

FUD1_AFISHNISH_1 = ~z~Hey, I reckon we call it a day, fellers.

FUD1_AFISHNISH_2 = ~z~Already?

FUD1_AFISHNISH_3 = ~z~You ain't been chasing down outlaws.

FUD1_ARRIVE_2 = ~z~Up there on your left is the Rhodes Parlor House.

FUD1_ARRIVE_3 = ~z~Very reputable saloon, owned by the Gray family.

FUD1_ARRIVE_5 = ~z~What more do you need?

FUD1_ARRIVE_6 = ~z~Very little.

FUD1_BAITRE_01 = ~z~Some bait on your hook might help.

FUD1_BAITRE_02 = ~z~You won't get too far with no bait, Arthur.

FUD1_BAITRE_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4:1~Are you gonna bait that hook?

FUD1_BAITRE_04 = ~z~Don't think too hard, Arthur, just bait and cast.

FUD1_BANT1SHOUTED_14 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.4~Make enough money, ~rp~then find somewhere where nobody'll find us,~lr:0.1~where we don't have to hide.

FUD1_BANT1SHOUTED_16 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I got some ideas hatching...~sl:0.3~~rp~but I need you with me, ~rp~not against me. ~rp~Both of you.

FUD1_BANT1_6 = ~z~More Charles than me.

FUD1_BANT1_8 = ~z~Might even do your whistling pipes some good, Hosea.

FUD1_BANT1_10 = ~z~It was a lifetime ago.

FUD1_BANT1_12 = ~z~I hope so.

FUD1_BANT1_13 = ~z~But now, ~rp~when things are desperate, ~rp~we have to stick with the plan.

FUD1_BANT1_17 = ~z~'Course.

FUD1_BANT1_19 = ~z~After Valentine, I want everyone on best behaviour here, ~rp~no trouble...

FUD1_BANT1_20 = ~z~but start turning over the soil and the rocks... ~rp~see what turns up.

FUD1_BANT1_21 = ~z~Dutch... we have gotta be discreet.

FUD1_BANT1_22 = ~z~Imagine what a slew of rich simpletons there must be down here.

FUD1_BANT2ASHOUTED_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Anders back there is the brains of the operation,~sl:~and that's really saying something.

FUD1_BANT2ASPOKEN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Anders back there is the brains of the operation,~sl:~and that's really saying something.

FUD1_BANT2A_1 = ~z~What about the others?

FUD1_BANT2A_2 = ~z~Oh, we'll round them up.

FUD1_BANT2A_4 = ~z~You're the boss.

FUD1_BANT2A_5 = ~z~That was mighty impressive, sir, I have to admit.

FUD1_BANT2A_6 = ~z~I'd hazard a guess you've served the law yourself at some point.

FUD1_BANT2A_7 = ~z~Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

FUD1_BANT2BSHOUTED_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~My family's been working for them for years.~sl:0.0:2.7~Sheriff Gray's the one I know best of course,~sl:~but they own half the businesses in town.

FUD1_BANT2B_1 = ~z~Are you familiar with the area here?

FUD1_BANT2B_2 = ~z~No, not really.

FUD1_BANT2B_3 = ~z~On your right here, these tobacco fields.

FUD1_BANT2B_4 = ~z~This is part of Caliga Hall, big estate belonging to the Gray family.

FUD1_BANT2B_5 = ~z~Looks bone dry.

FUD1_BANT2B_6 = ~z~Yes, we are in dire need of some rain round here, let me tell you.

FUD1_BANT2B_7 = ~z~The Grays have lived at Caliga Hall for generations. Fine people.

FUD1_BANT2B_9 = ~z~Which town?

FUD1_BANT2B_10 = ~z~Rhodes, sir. You don't know it? Where we're headed right now.

FUD1_BANT2B_11 = ~z~Ain't what it was before the war, but it has its charms.

FUD1_BANT2B_13 = ~z~Like I said, we just got down here.

FUD1_BANT2B_15 = ~z~Awful people, truly awful.

FUD1_BANT2B_17 = ~z~Sounds like quite the place you got here.

FUD1_BARN_01 = ~z~Go through the barn!

FUD1_BARN_02 = ~z~Cut through that barn!

FUD1_BOTTLE_01 = ~z~Watch out, he's throwing bottles at us.

FUD1_BOTTLE_02 = ~z~Now he's throwing bottles. The lowdown bastard.

FUD1_BT_BACKIN_01 = ~z~Are you done?

FUD1_BT_BACKIN_02 = ~z~A pleasant dip? Now come on.

FUD1_BT_BACKIN_03 = ~z~Can we go now? Enjoy those wet clothes.

FUD1_BT_GETINH_01 = ~z~Will you get back in?

FUD1_BT_GETINH_02 = ~z~You really think this is the time for a swim?

FUD1_BT_GETINH_03 = ~z~Come on, that's enough now.

FUD1_BT_GETINH_04 = ~z~Just get back in the boat, Arthur.

FUD1_BT_GETINH_05 = ~z~Will you stop messing around?

FUD1_BT_GETINH_06 = ~z~Is this supposed to be amusing?

FUD1_BT_GETINH_07 = ~z~I'll put a hook in you if you don't get back in the boat.

FUD1_BT_GIVEUP_01 = ~z~Just leave him, he'll get tired eventually.

FUD1_BT_GIVEUP_02 = ~z~Just ignore him, he'll get bored soon enough.

FUD1_BT_JUMPOUT_01 = ~z~Hey, what are you doing?

FUD1_BT_JUMPOUT_02 = ~z~Arthur!

FUD1_BT_JUMPOUT_03 = ~z~What the hell, Arthur?

FUD1_CHASE2_01 = ~z~And do not shoot them, you hear me?

FUD1_CHASE2_02 = ~z~And keep your guns holstered! We need them Anderson boys alive.

FUD1_CHASEBANT_1 = ~z~Faster, come on. What's your name, sir?

FUD1_CHASEBANT_2 = ~z~Arthur. Arthur Callahan.

FUD1_CHASEBANT_3 = ~z~Faster, Mr. Callahan, please. My neck is on the line here.

FUD1_CHASEBANT_4 = ~z~I get it. I'm doing my best.

FUD1_CHASEIDLE_01 = ~z~What are you waiting for, Arthur?

FUD1_CHASEIDLE_02 = ~z~Go on. Get after that train.

FUD1_CHASEIDLE_03 = ~z~Quick, they're getting away.

FUD1_CHASE_01 = ~z~Stay with that train. Don't let them get away.

FUD1_CHASE_02 = ~z~Let's go! After that train!

FUD1_CLIMB_1 = ~z~Looks like the son of a bitch is gonna make it.

FUD1_CLIMB_2 = ~z~You sure I can't just shoot him?

FUD1_CLIMB_3 = ~z~No. Did I not say that?

FUD1_CLIMB_4 = ~z~You've said plenty.

FUD1_CLOSE_1 = ~z~Come on, hurry.

FUD1_CLOSE_2 = ~z~All right.

FUD1_CLOSE_3 = ~z~Come on, we're losing them.

FUD1_CLOSE_4 = ~z~Will you relax? We're not losing 'em.

FUD1_CRIMINAL3_1 = ~z~Damn bastard.

FUD1_CRIMINAL3_2 = ~z~Get the hell away from me.

FUD1_CRIM_INFO2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Tortured two fellers to within an inch of their lives.~sl:0.1~We've been after them for five years or more now.

FUD1_CRIM_INFO2_2 = ~z~Oh Lord. I've locked the darn wagon. He'll blame it on me for sure.

FUD1_CRIM_INFO2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.3~We're right on them, just stay calm.

FUD1_CRIM_INFO2_4 = ~z~I am calm!

FUD1_CRIM_INFO_1 = ~z~So what are these fellers wanted for?

FUD1_CRIM_INFO_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Oh, the Anderson Boys?~sl:~Robbery, murder, kidnapping... they're the lowest of the low.

FUD1_DEPRIDE_1 = ~z~I'm going to ride ahead and stop the train!

FUD1_DEPSHOUT_01 = ~z~I'm right out here if you need me.

FUD1_DEPSHOUT_02 = ~z~Tempting as it might be, do not kill him.

FUD1_DEPSHOUT_03 = ~z~I don't think I can open the door from the outside, unfortunately.

FUD1_DEPSHOUT_04 = ~z~Watch yourself, he's as dirty as they come.

FUD1_DEPSHOUT_05 = ~z~Just subdue him and we'll take him in, alright?

FUD1_DEPUTYSTOP_1 = ~z~Stop!

FUD1_DEP_OUT_1 = ~z~Hello? Is everything alright in there?

FUD1_DONT_1 = ~z~Just don't kill him.

FUD1_DONT_2 = ~z~Are you sure?

FUD1_DONT_3 = ~z~Sadly so...

FUD1_DPBITE_01 = ~z~You got something biting, Arthur.

FUD1_DPBITE_02 = ~z~Arthur's got a bite.

FUD1_DPBITE_03 = ~z~You got a bite there, Arthur?

FUD1_DPCATCH_01 = ~z~Not bad, Arthur.

FUD1_DPCATCH_02 = ~z~You're getting the hang of this.

FUD1_DPCATCH_03 = ~z~There you go. That's a nice one.

FUD1_DPHOOK_01 = ~z~Nice, you hooked him.

FUD1_DPHOOK_02 = ~z~That's on the hook, Arthur.

FUD1_DPHOOK_03 = ~z~Just gotta reel him in now, Arthur.

FUD1_DPKEEP_01 = ~z~Yeah, that's a keeper.

FUD1_DPKEEP_02 = ~z~Oh, Arthur's pleased with that one.

FUD1_DPKEEP_03 = ~z~Make sure you don't forget about that and let it rot in the bag.

FUD1_DPLOSE_01 = ~z~No, you lost him.

FUD1_DPLOSE_02 = ~z~~sl:0.3~He got the better of you, I'm afraid.

FUD1_DPLOSE_03 = ~z~He's gone, Arthur. Try again.

FUD1_DPTHROW_01 = ~z~So kind, Arthur.

FUD1_DPTHROW_02 = ~z~See? You don't kill everything.

FUD1_DPTHROW_03 = ~z~Maybe we throw Trelawny back in too.

FUD1_DUT_BITE_01 = ~z~I think that's a bite.

FUD1_DUT_BITE_02 = ~z~Ok, that's was a bite.

FUD1_DUT_BITE_03 = ~z~They're nibbling...

FUD1_DUT_HOOK_01 = ~z~Got him.

FUD1_DUT_HOOK_02 = ~z~There he is.

FUD1_DUT_HOOK_03 = ~z~There, hooked him.

FUD1_DUT_TEASE_01 = ~z~~sl:1.3~That wouldn't even make a meal for Jack.

FUD1_DUT_TEASE_02 = ~z~That tiddler barely counts, Arthur.

FUD1_DWHYNOFSH_02 = ~z~Are you bored already, Arthur?

FUD1_DWNDSK_1 = ~z~This is the perfect time. Catch the best fish at dawn and dusk.

FUD1_END_1 = ~z~Well, I am going to take in the view.

FUD1_END_2 = ~z~I'll give these fish to Pearson.

FUD1_EQUIPROD_01 = ~z~You won't catch much without a rod.

FUD1_EQUIPROD_02 = ~z~Where's your rod, Arthur?

FUD1_EQUIPROD_03 = ~z~Come on, Arthur, don't be nervous.

FUD1_EXT_1 = ~z~Alright...

FUD1_EXT_2 = ~z~I think...

FUD1_EXT_3 = ~z~I...

FUD1_EXT_4 = ~z~well, I mean we...

FUD1_EXT_5 = ~z~are gonna be okay.

FUD1_EXT_6 = ~z~I know...

FUD1_EXT_8 = ~z~whenever I got...

FUD1_EXT_9 = ~z~you two by my side...

FUD1_EXT_10 = ~z~things are gonna be just fine.

FUD1_EXT_11 = ~z~This place will be good for us.

FUD1_EXT_12 = ~z~For now, anyway.

FUD1_EXT_13 = ~z~I hope so.

FUD1_FASTER_01 = ~z~Faster!

FUD1_FASTER_02 = ~z~Get closer!

FUD1_FASTER_03 = ~z~Can't you go any faster?

FUD1_FASTER_04 = ~z~Don't let these bastards get away.

FUD1_FASTER_05 = ~z~Let's go, come on!

FUD1_FASTER_06 = ~z~Get a move on!

FUD1_FIGHT_01 = ~z~Do it.

FUD1_FIGHT_02 = ~z~Come on. Come on...

FUD1_FIGHT_03 = ~z~Try at least.

FUD1_FIGHT_04 = ~z~Need some gin? Come on.

FUD1_FISHGTBOAT_1 = ~z~I'm sure nobody would mind if we borrowed one of these. Come on.

FUD1_FISHINFO_1 = ~z~We should use a lake lure, that'll give us a much better chance of hooking something big like a sturgeon.

FUD1_FISHINFO_2 = ~z~What's wrong with a good old worm?

FUD1_FISHINFO_3 = ~z~Worms are good for tiddlers like bluegill and rockbass, but you'd have to be real lucky to catch a sturgeon with one.

FUD1_FISHINFO_4 = ~z~Lures it is then. You heard the expert, Arthur. Let's bait up.

FUD1_FISHINFO_5 = ~z~Keep the lure moving slowly on the water so it looks like a little fish just asking to be eaten.

FUD1_FISHTALK1_1 = ~z~Hey Hosea, you remember that time we sent Arthur out fishing? He came back with three beautiful bass?

FUD1_FISHTALK1_2 = ~z~Not this again...

FUD1_FISHTALK1_3 = ~z~I don't think I do.

FUD1_FISHTALK1_4 = ~z~Oh yeah, you do. He was maybe twenty, twenty-one.

FUD1_FISHTALK1_5 = ~z~Walked in all full of himself, we had a big feast, toasted him all night.

FUD1_FISHTALK1_6 = ~z~This was fifteen years ago.

FUD1_FISHTALK1_7 = ~z~Oh I remember now.

FUD1_FISHTALK1_8 = ~z~~sl:0.6~Then the next week, Arthur and I are at the market,

FUD1_FISHTALK1_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9:1~and fishmonger calls out, “So how did you enjoy those bass?”

FUD1_FISHTALK1_10 = ~z~Look, you can fish, or you can go drinking all day,

FUD1_FISHTALK1_11 = ~z~rob someone, and buy some fish.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_1 = ~z~I used to go fishing with this feller back in the day.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_2 = ~z~Wesley, his name was.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_3 = ~z~Real miserable bastard, but he loved to fish. We'd go out all the time.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~But... one day, we were river fishing...~sl:0.1~when we see a funeral procession going over the bridge and

FUD1_FISHTALK2_5 = ~z~out of the blue, Wesley stands up, takes off his hat, bows his head.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Then, he sits down, picks his rod back up and carries on,~sl:0.1~doesn't say a word.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_7 = ~z~So I'm a little surprised and say, “Wesley, that was nice of you.”

FUD1_FISHTALK2_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~And he replies, “Well, felt I had to. After all,~sl:0.0:2.1:1~I was married to her for thirty years.”

FUD1_FISHTALK2_9 = ~z~Oh, there he is.

FUD1_FISHTALK2_10 = ~z~Oh dear God... I might swim to shore.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_5 = ~z~You know I remember us saying how Blackwater was the further east we'd ever been, as a group I mean.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_6 = ~z~Feels like the more we try to head west, the further east we end up.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_7 = ~z~We had all those safe spots picked out to lie low in New Austin after the ferry job.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_8 = ~z~I liked it there. Still open and wild, the way it should be.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_9 = ~z~Somehow the desert makes you feel closer to the sky.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_10 = ~z~No point us trying to get back that way any time soon.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_11 = ~z~The Pinkertons have patrols out all over Tall Trees and Great Plains.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_12 = ~z~We saw when we went back for Sean.

FUD1_FISHTALK3_13 = ~z~Well, look at us now, huh? It could be worse. Plans change, that's just how life goes.

FUD1_FISHTALK4_1 = ~z~Did I ever tell you my mother's buried in Blackwater?

FUD1_FISHTALK4_2 = ~z~Really? She is?

FUD1_FISHTALK4_3 = ~z~Apparently so. I only found out from an uncle of mine years later.

FUD1_FISHTALK4_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Last I knew she was still outside Philadelphia.~sl:0.8:3.0~I left home at fifteen and didn't see her again.~sl:1.1~She and I didn't always see eye to eye.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1SHOUTED_6 = ~z~We'll see if you're as good at catching fish ~rp~as you are at catching criminals, Arthur.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_1 = ~z~So how far is this creek?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_2 = ~z~It's a bit of a ride still. ~rp~And it's not a creek. ~rp~It's the same lake we camped on, just a different part.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_3 = ~z~It'll be worth it...  ~rp~I saw some big drum and sturgeon there...

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_4 = ~z~should be rock bass, ~rp~bluegills, ~rp~perch, ~rp~pickerel too.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_5 = ~z~It's a good spot.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_7 = ~z~Trelawny owes me for that.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_9 = ~z~Plus we are now ingratiated with the local law,

FUD1_FSHRDBNT1_10 = ~z~I'd say it was a worthwhile diversion all round.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT2_1 = ~z~So, ~rp~you're going back to see that Sheriff Gray?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT2_2 = ~z~Yeah, ~rp~I don't see why not. ~rp~They don't know who we are down here.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT2_3 = ~z~He didn't seem the sharpest of tacks. ~rp~Neither did that deputy.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT2_4 = ~z~If he thinks we can be useful to him, ~rp~he can certainly be useful to us.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_1 = ~z~Where is this spot, Hosea? ~rp~Timbuktu?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_2 = ~z~Not too much farther.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_3 = ~z~Anyway, ~rp~you two never told me properly about that business with Cornwall in Valentine?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_4 = ~z~What happened there? ~rp~Apart from scaring the living daylights out of Mr. Strauss.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_5 = ~z~That was about the only upside.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_6 = ~z~John and I ~rp~didn't even have time to get paid for the sheep we rustled.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_7 = ~z~It is safe to Mr. Cornwall isn't a man to let bygones be bygones.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_8 = ~z~Ambushed us in the saloon.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_10 = ~z~We've had closer shaves, ~rp~but not that many.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_11 = ~z~And if Cornwall found us, ~rp~the Pinkertons couldn't have been far behind.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_12 = ~z~They found me when I was fishing with Jack, remember?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT3_13 = ~z~Listen, ~rp~it was good we moved when we did, ~rp~but that mess is behind us now.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4SHOUTED_1 = ~z~So ~rp~what Trelawny said about those bounty hunters. ~rp~What you think?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4SHOUTED_7 = ~z~Not until I've thought it through. ~rp~Interesting about those two families.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4SPOKEN_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Not until I've thought it through. ~rp~~sl:0.8~Interesting about those two families.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_2 = ~z~I told you, ~rp~I've had bounty hunters after me for years. ~rp~When was the last time I didn't have a price on my head?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_3 = ~z~Seems a little bigger now, Dutch.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_4 = ~z~"Super agents"... ~rp~that's just Trelawny over-egging the pudding like the showman he is.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_5 = ~z~Unless there's a new breed of special man I don't know about.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_6 = ~z~So, do nothing?

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_8 = ~z~We'll look into it.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT4_9 = ~z~Good. ~rp~Like I said when we set off, ~rp~just start turning the soil. ~rp~Low profile.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT5SHOUTED_2 = ~z~I'm not sure how good a magician he is, ~rp~but he's certainly good at disappearing when he feels like it.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT5_7 = ~z~~sl:0.8:0.0~Oh yeah... ~rp~we hadn't seen him in weeks.

FUD1_FSHRDBNT5_8 = ~z~We stopped in some dead-end town in the middle of nowhere, ~rp~don't even remember the name.
