NTS1_EXT_3 = ~z~I will.

NTS1_EXT_4 = ~z~I like you, son...

NTS1_EXT_5 = ~z~and after the horses are we gonna wait...

NTS1_EXT_6 = ~z~for the army to come and wreak its revenge?

NTS1_EXT_7 = ~z~I hope not.

NTS1_EXT_8 = ~z~Of course we ain't...

NTS1_EXT_9 = ~z~now let's go check out that fort of theirs.

NTS1_EXT_10 = ~z~Is this a good idea?

NTS1_EXT_11 = ~z~This is the only idea...

NTS1_EXT_12 = ~z~and it is one that will suit both of our purposes.

NTS1_EXT_13 = ~z~Fighting the army ain't wise.

NTS1_EXT_22 = ~z~I don't know, Dutch...

NTS1_EXT_23 = ~z~Yeah well, I do.

NTS1_EXT_24 = ~z~This is exactly the distraction that we need.

NTS1_EXT_25 = ~z~Your father said that fighting was an impossible gamble.

NTS1_EXT_26 = ~z~There's no winning for you in this.

NTS1_EXT_27 = ~z~Father need not know anything...

NTS1_EXT_28 = ~z~he'd rather live in ignorance.

NTS1_EXT_29 = ~z~Come along, gentlemen.

NTS1_EXT_30 = ~z~Your father would rather you did not do anything so foolish!

NTS1_EXT_31 = ~z~I said I would stop this from happening...

NTS1_EXT_32 = ~z~would you talk to him?

NTS1_EXT_33 = ~z~Speak with Rains Fall?

NTS1_EXT_34 = ~z~Yes.

NTS1_EXT_35 = ~z~Would you?

NTS1_EXT_36 = ~z~Sure.

NTS1_EXT_37 = ~z~I'll speak with him.

NTS1_EXT_38 = ~z~I just...

NTS1_EXT_39 = ~z~I can't get any more involved in this business, Charles.

NTS1_EXT_40 = ~z~It's...

NTS1_EXT_41 = ~z~it's not my fight.

NTS1_EXT_42 = ~z~You head on back to camp, check on the others.

NTS1_EXT_43 = ~z~Dutch's behavior it's...

NTS1_EXT_44 = ~z~I understand.

NTS1_EXT_45 = ~z~Thank you, Arthur.

NTS1_EXT_LI2_1 = ~z~Will one of you help me return the horses to my men?

NTS1_EXT_LI_1 = ~z~Ah, seems like Uncle Sam likes you fellers even less than he likes us!

NTS1_EXT_LI_2 = ~z~So it goes... my father doesn't want to fight again.

NTS1_EXT_LI_3 = ~z~

NTS1_EXT_LI_4 = ~z~Well, he is a wise man, but you know... I think that I agree with you.

NTS1_EXT_LI_5 = ~z~There's only so much treachery and betrayal that a man can take...

NTS1_EXT_LI_6 = ~z~before he must admit to himself that he is no longer a man.

NTS1_EXT_LI_7 = ~z~Never thought about it in those terms.

NTS1_EXT_LI_8 = ~z~An old friend of Evelyn Miller like you? I doubt that.

NTS1_EXT_LI_9 = ~z~You know I never had a son...

NTS1_EXT_LI_10 = ~z~Your father must be a great man... he raised you.

NTS1_EXT_LI_11 = ~z~Thank you.

NTS1_EXT_LI_12 = ~z~Gentlemen...

NTS1_HEARD_01 = ~z~Wait here, I'll go take a look...

NTS1_HEARD_02 = ~z~Is everything okay around there?

NTS1_HEARD_03 = ~z~Need some help back there?

NTS1_HORSECALL2_1 = ~z~Over here, come on.

NTS1_HORSECALL_01 = ~z~Come here.

NTS1_HORSECALL_02 = ~z~Come on.

NTS1_IG1_1 = ~z~We need to get that boat ashore...

NTS1_IG1_2 = ~z~I think the best plan is to paddle up there silently, board her,

NTS1_IG1_3 = ~z~and when we got control, we'll deal with that anchor, float away.

NTS1_IG1_4 = ~z~We'll be ashore before anybody even knows what happened.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_1 = ~z~

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.3:0.0~No, not again.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_3 = ~z~I ain't had a sniff of a good hand all night.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_4 = ~z~I'll be retiring in the morning at this rate.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_5 = ~z~Just deal, will you?

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_6 = ~z~I'm in.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_7 = ~z~Raise you.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_8 = ~z~We can go higher than that.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_9 = ~z~Goddamn it, no... I'm out.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_10 = ~z~Alright. Call.

NTS1_IG3_P1_A_11 = ~z~

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_1 = ~z~Full house!

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_2 = ~z~For Christ's sakes, Pennington, you're taking us for a ride here.

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2:1~I'd say I'm sorry, fellers, but I'd be lying!

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_4 = ~z~Don't know what I'm gonna tell my wife...

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_5 = ~z~"Sorry darling, no food this month. That cheating bastard Pennington robbed it all!"

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7:1~Send her over to me, I got lots of money.

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_7 = ~z~Now that's just plain rude.

NTS1_IG3_P1_B_8 = ~z~

NTS1_IG3_P1_C_1 = ~z~What the hell?

NTS1_IG3_P1_C_2 = ~z~Shit, we got a problem here!

NTS1_IG4_1 = ~z~Boys, go find out about those horses down below.

NTS1_IG4_2 = ~z~Arthur, deal with that anchor.

NTS1_IG4_B_1 = ~z~Come on, Arthur.

NTS1_IG4_GEST_1 = ~z~Sure.

NTS1_INT_1 = ~z~Reverend.

NTS1_INT_2 = ~z~You okay, Mr. Morgan?

NTS1_INT_3 = ~z~I don't know, Reverend.

NTS1_INT_4 = ~z~These are challenging times...

NTS1_INT_5 = ~z~for all of us...

NTS1_INT_6 = ~z~Yes...

NTS1_INT_7 = ~z~very challenging.

NTS1_INT_8 = ~z~You don't seem yourself, somehow...

NTS1_INT_9 = ~z~I've always felt...

NTS1_INT_10 = ~z~I've left the morphine, sir. I'm...

NTS1_INT_11 = ~z~Arthur!

NTS1_INT_12 = ~z~Reverend Swanson, would you excuse us a minute.

NTS1_INT_13 = ~z~Of course...

NTS1_INT_14 = ~z~New York...

NTS1_INT_15 = ~z~we are gonna go to New York.

NTS1_INT_16 = ~z~Now they have been chasing us south and east and west.

NTS1_INT_17 = ~z~We're gonna get a boat...

NTS1_INT_18 = ~z~we're gonna get on a river...

NTS1_INT_19 = ~z~and we're gonna go north.

NTS1_INT_20 = ~z~New York?

NTS1_INT_21 = ~z~Then Tahiti, the Fiji Islands, or this place, New Guinea.

NTS1_INT_22 = ~z~Dancing girls,  freedom...

NTS1_INT_23 = ~z~But first we have to make a whole lot of smoke...

NTS1_INT_24 = ~z~a whole lot of commotion...

NTS1_INT_25 = ~z~and then we disappear.

NTS1_INT_26 = ~z~We need more commotion?

NTS1_INT_27 = ~z~One score, and one whole hell of a lot of noise.

NTS1_INT_28 = ~z~We ain't so good at doing scores any more, Dutch.

NTS1_INT_29 = ~z~Are you feeling alright, Arthur?

NTS1_INT_30 = ~z~Sure, I'm fine...

NTS1_INT_31 = ~z~Pardon me for interrupting.

NTS1_INT_32 = ~z~I've brought a friend, Arthur.

NTS1_INT_33 = ~z~Hello.

NTS1_INT_34 = ~z~Hello.

NTS1_INT_35 = ~z~Dutch, this is Eagle Flies...

NTS1_INT_36 = ~z~his father is a great chief.

NTS1_INT_37 = ~z~Charles and I we erm...

NTS1_INT_38 = ~z~Pretended to be mercenaries...

NTS1_INT_39 = ~z~did me a great favor.

NTS1_INT_40 = ~z~Dutch van der Linde.

NTS1_INT_41 = ~z~How do you do?

NTS1_INT_42 = ~z~Not well, sir.

NTS1_INT_43 = ~z~Well, I am sorry to hear that.

NTS1_INT_44 = ~z~How's your father?

NTS1_INT_45 = ~z~Father has confused wisdom with weakness.

NTS1_INT_46 = ~z~His people, my people...

NTS1_INT_47 = ~z~we've suffered too much...

NTS1_INT_48 = ~z~been lied to too much...

NTS1_INT_49 = ~z~now, they've taken our horses.

NTS1_INT_50 = ~z~Who?

NTS1_INT_51 = ~z~The infantry division posted at Fort Wallace.

NTS1_INT_52 = ~z~Why?

NTS1_INT_53 = ~z~Colonel Favours is a liar and a murderer...

NTS1_INT_54 = ~z~his people won't stop until we're all dead.

NTS1_INT_55 = ~z~Without horses, we cannot hunt...

NTS1_INT_56 = ~z~without hunting...

NTS1_INT_57 = ~z~we will starve.

NTS1_INT_58 = ~z~This is another act of war.

NTS1_INT_59 = ~z~I see that.

NTS1_INT_60 = ~z~You men have helped me before...

NTS1_INT_61 = ~z~and I have money.

NTS1_INT_62 = ~z~Put your money away, son.

NTS1_INT_63 = ~z~What do you think, Charles?

NTS1_INT_64 = ~z~You know I told your father I will not fight over some horses.

NTS1_INT_65 = ~z~But I made no such promise.

NTS1_INT_66 = ~z~Come along...

NTS1_INT_67 = ~z~Arthur, we must go with them...

NTS1_INT_68 = ~z~to try to stop things from getting...

NTS1_INT_69 = ~z~out of hand.

NTS1_INT_70 = ~z~I guess...

NTS1_INT_71 = ~z~come along.

NTS1_MCS4_1 = ~z~We seem to be going pretty fast, Dutch.

NTS1_MCS4_2 = ~z~I'm trying.

NTS1_MCS4_3 = ~z~We're heading to those rocks.

NTS1_MCS4_4 = ~z~Hold on!

NTS1_MCS4_5 = ~z~What is wrong with you?

NTS1_MCS4_6 = ~z~You boys alright back there?

NTS1_MCS4_7 = ~z~Yeah, I think so...

NTS1_MCS4_8 = ~z~but there's a huge hole in the boat...

NTS1_MCS4_9 = ~z~the horses are spooked...

NTS1_MCS4_10 = ~z~and we're taking on water.

NTS1_MCS4_11 = ~z~Come on, let's get 'em outta here.

NTS1_MCS4_12 = ~z~Go on, go on!

NTS1_MCS4_13 = ~z~Well whatever else is wrong with you...

NTS1_MCS4_14 = ~z~you're quite the best pilot I've ever come across.

NTS1_NOKILL_1 = ~z~Try not to kill anyone, Arthur.

NTS1_NOTFOUND_01 = ~z~I must be going crazy...

NTS1_NOTFOUND_02 = ~z~Nothing...

NTS1_NOTFOUND_03 = ~z~Guess it was nothing.

NTS1_OVERBOARD_1 = ~z~Arthur, what are you doing? They'll hear us.

NTS1_PADDLEOFF_1 = ~z~Good luck.

NTS1_PADDLEWRN_01 = ~z~Easy, they are going to hear us.

NTS1_PADDLEWRN_02 = ~z~Try not to splash too much, Arthur.

NTS1_QUIETLY_1 = ~z~Pull up alongside... quietly.

NTS1_RALLY_1 = ~z~Thank you for this.

NTS1_RALLY_2 = ~z~You're going to let these bastards walk all over you? No, you're not!

NTS1_RALLY_3 = ~z~This is all that's wrong with this world.

NTS1_RIDE_DIS_5 = ~z~Anyway, son, tell me about this Colonel Favours?

NTS1_SMOKE_02 = ~z~I'm gonna go smoke, alright? Be back in a bit.

NTS1_SWIM_1 = ~z~The horses are confused, we need to round them up.
