SCVR_0956A_1 = ~z~Don't reckon I seen you in here before? You new to town?

SCVR_0956B_1 = ~z~Well, Rhodes ain't what it used to be. Not for some time now.

SCVR_0956B_2 = ~z~Ain't sure if you heard of the Gray family already...

SCVR_0956B_3 = ~z~they own this damn saloon, they own the damn law, hell they own pretty much most of this town now.

SCVR_0956B_4 = ~z~And it ain't better for it, in my opinion. But a drink's a drink... right, my friend?

SCVR_0956B_5 = ~z~Good luck to you.

SCVR_0957A_1 = ~z~So you a Gray or Braithwaite, mister?

SCVR_0957B_1 = ~z~Don't much matter to me anyways... both as bad as each other.

SCVR_0957B_2 = ~z~Near ruined this town, hell this whole county, with their damn feud.

SCVR_1052B_2 = ~z~We've been having a lot of trouble with another family, the Braithwaites,

SCVR_1052B_3 = ~z~the kind of lowdown folk who'll do anything to put another dollar in their pockets and take another one out of yours.

SCVR_1052B_4 = ~z~It's a long story, but we're all on our guard of late.

SCVR_1052B_5 = ~z~So, just be careful where you wander round these parts, you hear?
