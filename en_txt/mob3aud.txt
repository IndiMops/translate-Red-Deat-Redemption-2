MOB3_INT_15 = ~z~We've been doing well, making money...

MOB3_INT_16 = ~z~but for us all to leave together...

MOB3_INT_17 = ~z~we need enough for a boat.

MOB3_INT_18 = ~z~Now I found a friendly ship captain...

MOB3_INT_19 = ~z~he's willing to take us to Australia, or Tahiti.

MOB3_INT_20 = ~z~We just need to pay for passage and...
