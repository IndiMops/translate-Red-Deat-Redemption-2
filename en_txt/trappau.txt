TRAPP_APPROACH_01 = ~z~Now look at that for some headwear. Suits you.

TRAPP_APPROACH_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~Impressive.~sl:0.4:3.25~If I'd know you were going to show up in that, I'd've worn my polar bear.

TRAPP_APPROACH_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.46~I like your style.~sl:0.5:2.5~A trophy like that deserves to be shown off.

TRAPP_APPROACH_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Look at you. Splendid.~sl:~I hardly know which eyes to look you in.

TRAPP_APPRSMALL_01 = ~z~Nice hat.

TRAPP_APPRSMALL_02 = ~z~Don't let Miss Davenport see you with that on your head.

TRAPP_APPRSMALL_03 = ~z~I like the hat.

TRAPP_APPRSMALL_04 = ~z~Can I start by saying I fully approve of the headwear?

TRAPP_APPRSMALL_05 = ~z~Bet that keeps your head warm, huh?

TRAPP_APPRSMALL_06 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Well, you certainly look the part.~sl:~Nothing like the feel of a good pelt on the pate, is there?

TRAPP_BEAVERTOO_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~The more you can do to keep your tools of the trade~sl:~in good working order, the better.

TRAPP_BOUNTY_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~From the hunter to the hunted, huh?~sl:0.5~I think you should clear that bounty before we resume business, don't you?

TRAPP_BOUNTY_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~I like hunters, bounty hunters not so much.~sl:~So, I suggest you come back when you've settled your nefarious accounts, okay?

TRAPP_BOUNTY_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Sorry, I can't be seen fraternizing with someone who has a price on their head.~sl:~I have a reputation to uphold.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~A nice addition to a bow,~sl:~any gunsmith should be able to fit it for you.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~I can't put that on for you,~sl:~but any gunsmith should be able to.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_03 = ~z~Stop by a gunsmith, they'll be able to fit that for you.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~That's a nice grip,~sl:~if you stop in at the gunsmith in town, he'll fit it for you.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_05 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~You'll like the feel of that.~sl:~Any gunsmith should be able to put it on for you.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_06 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Probably best to get a gunsmith to fit it on your bow.~sl:~Make sure it's balanced right.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_07 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~I've got the same one on my bow.~sl:~A gunsmith fitted it for me.

TRAPP_BOWGRIPS_08 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~That's a beauty. I'd ask a gunsmith to equip it for you.~sl:~He'll know the best placement.

TRAPP_BUCKANTLE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~This should increase your chances of a clean kill and a quality pelt.~sl:~That's where the money is.

TRAPP_CALLOUT_01 = ~z~Hey, wait, you stopping?

TRAPP_CALLOUT_02 = ~z~Hey, over here!

TRAPP_CALLOUT_03 = ~z~Hey, not so fast there!

TRAPP_CALLOUT_04 = ~z~Hey, stop a minute, will you?

TRAPP_DEADANIMA_01 = ~z~Nice kill!

TRAPP_DEADANIMA_02 = ~z~I see you come bearing gifts!

TRAPP_DEADANIMA_03 = ~z~Now, that's what I like to see.

TRAPP_DEADANIMA_04 = ~z~Had some luck out there, huh?

TRAPP_ELEPHRIFL_01 = ~z~That'll pack a punch.

TRAPP_ELEPHRIFL_02 = ~z~I went through cases of this in Africa.

TRAPP_ELEPHRIFL_03 = ~z~Going after the big'uns, huh? I highly approve.

TRAPP_ELEPHRIFL_04 = ~z~There's nothing this won't take down.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_01 = ~z~Alright, good luck out there.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_02 = ~z~One day I'll have to tell you about my summer hunting walrus on Unimak.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_03 = ~z~Okay, make me proud out there.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_04 = ~z~Like I always say, I aim to please, but I shoot to kill.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_05 = ~z~Let me know if there's anything else you need.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_06 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You know, I envy you.~sl:~The thrill of the kill. I miss it.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_07 = ~z~If you see Harriet on your travels, please give her my worst regards.

TRAPP_FAREWELL_08 = ~z~Happy hunting.

TRAPP_FIRSTTIME_01 = ~z~Okay then, let's get you kitted out.

TRAPP_FIRSTTIME_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Good to see you again,~sl:~what can I do for you?

TRAPP_FIRSTTIME_03 = ~z~Alrighty, my friend, you have come to the right place.

TRAPP_GREETBIGV_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~So much good hunting in the hills around here,~sl:~almost makes me want to come out of retirement.

TRAPP_GREETBIGV_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~This is about as close to Strawberry as I plan to get for the time being.~sl:~I don't need another run-in with Miss Davenport.

TRAPP_GREETBIGV_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Smell that mountain air...~sl:~is it any wonder my appetite is so healthy when I'm out this way.

TRAPP_GREETCHOL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Something about desert hunting, isn't there?~sl:~Separates the wheat from the chaff.

TRAPP_GREETCHOL_02 = ~z~Watch your step, there was a rattler sniffing around earlier.

TRAPP_GREETCHOL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~I always like coming out here. The dry air.~sl:0.44~Reminds of my days in Africa.

TRAPP_GREETCHRI_01 = ~z~I trust the festive season is treating you well?

TRAPP_GREETCHRI_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Come all ye faithful,~sl:~please make me joyful with your abundance.

TRAPP_GREETCHRI_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~Merry Christmas.~sl:~No greater gift to the hunter than a good blanket of snow.

TRAPP_GREETDNIS_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~Good timing. I just got back from a splendid meal at La Bastille.~sl:~If you haven't tried their dauphinoise potatoes, I highly recommend.

TRAPP_GREETDNIS_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Am I glad to see you. Business is booming!~sl:~These Saint Denis women and their furs, they can't get enough.

TRAPP_GREETDNIS_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~I love this city. An order list as long as my arm in less than a day.~sl:~We have work to do.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_01 = ~z~Good to see you.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_02 = ~z~Ah, I was just thinking about you.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_03 = ~z~Hello there.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_04 = ~z~Oh, hi there.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_05 = ~z~Well, look who it is.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_06 = ~z~How are you?

TRAPP_GREETGEN_07 = ~z~Hello.

TRAPP_GREETGEN_08 = ~z~My fellow hunter, hello again.

TRAPP_GREETHALL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~It's that time of year again, the witches are out.~sl:~Harriet Davenport finally has some company.

TRAPP_GREETHALL_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Oh good, it's you.~sl:0.0:2.8~I thought it was one of those damn pranksters again.~sl:~I hate this time of year, what a silly tradition.

TRAPP_GREETHALL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~I imagine it must be like Halloween every day~sl:~for Miss Davenport and her cauldron of potions.

TRAPP_GREETROAN_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~I swear, that soot from Annesburg...~sl:~crawls right up your nose and stays there.

TRAPP_GREETROAN_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~It's very nice to see a friendly face, I must say.~sl:~I've had nothing but crazies today... but I guess that's Roanoke Ridge for you.

TRAPP_GREETROAN_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~How's the hunting?~sl:0.0:5.1~I once killed ten black bear in a single day in the woods north of Van Horn.~sl:~Oh, to be young again.

TRAPP_GREETTALL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Well, I'm not surprised to see you round here.~sl:~It's a hunter's paradise.

TRAPP_GREETTALL_02 = ~z~Have you seen the elk round these parts? Just magnificent.

TRAPP_GREETTALL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~The hunting round here!~sl:0.0:3.8~I can't believe I never made it out this way in my younger days.~sl:~I'd have left a river of blood through these forests.

TRAPP_HIGHHONOR_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Ah, look who it is.~sl:~Quite the good Samaritan these days, from what I hear.

TRAPP_HIGHHONOR_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Ah, I've been hearing about you.~sl:0.5~Hope you've found time for some hunting among all these acts of philanthropy.

TRAPP_HIGHHONOR_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Well, aren't I fortunate to be graced~sl:0.0:2.7~by such an upstanding member of society.~sl:~Your reputation precedes you.

TRAPP_HIGHHONOR_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Reinventing yourself as a humanitarian of late, I hear?~sl:0.5~Hope this isn't that witch Davenport casting her spell.

TRAPP_HOGTIED_01 = ~z~I sincerely hope that one's not for me!

TRAPP_HOGTIED_02 = ~z~Er, that's not the kind of mammal I deal in, my friend.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I envy you, you know. The thrill of the chase...~sl:~there's nothing like it.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Take my advice... get out there and hunt as much as you can,~sl:~because age catches up with you fast. Believe me.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~You know, you remind me a lot of my younger self...~sl:0.4~and that's about the greatest compliment I can pay someone.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Please stay away from that crazy witch and her potions.~sl:~They'd have burned her alive in the good old days.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_05 = ~z~Don't feel like you need to linger on my account.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_06 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Did I ever tell about the giraffe I killed in Somalia?~sl:0.0:3.7~Fell off my wall in '86 and killed the cat...~sl:~so I'd say we finished about even.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_07 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Never say... “one day I'll hunt that”.~sl:~Make that day today. Because life is all too short.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_08 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.7~Whatever you do out there, avoid that lunatic Davenport at all costs.~sl:~She's nothing but a neurotic rich girl with too much time on her hands.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_09 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Well, I think that's my stomach telling me~sl:~it's time for a good plate of steak and potatoes.

TRAPP_IDLELINES_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Don't listen to the nonsense that woman spouts.~sl:0.0:3.0~A clean shot to the head is a far nobler death than~sl:~being poked and prodded in the pursuit of quackery.

TRAPP_IDLINGMEN_01 = ~z~Some time today would be nice.

TRAPP_IDLINGMEN_02 = ~z~I hate to rush you, but I am a busy man.

TRAPP_IDLINGMEN_03 = ~z~Okay... do you think we can hurry this along a bit?

TRAPP_INSUFFICI_01 = ~z~I don't think you have enough for this right now.

TRAPP_INSUFFICI_02 = ~z~Seems you're a little low on funds.

TRAPP_INSUFFICI_03 = ~z~I think you're going to have to save up for that.

TRAPP_INSUFFICI_04 = ~z~Looks like you're a little short there, my friend.

TRAPP_INSUFFICI_05 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~I can't just give it away, unfortunately.~sl:~I'm trying to run a business here.

TRAPP_INSUFFICI_06 = ~z~Looks like you're a little short on finances, unfortunately.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_01 = ~z~A superb choice.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_02 = ~z~Well worth the investment.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_03 = ~z~You get what you pay for.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_04 = ~z~An eye for quality, I see.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_05 = ~z~You won't regret it.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_06 = ~z~Worth every dollar.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_07 = ~z~Money well spent.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_08 = ~z~A wise decision.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_09 = ~z~Oh, an excellent choice.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_10 = ~z~Big spender. I like it.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_11 = ~z~Not cheap, but you'll be very glad of it.

TRAPP_ITEMPREM_12 = ~z~Very nice.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_01 = ~z~Good choice.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_02 = ~z~Can't go wrong with that.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_03 = ~z~Okay.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_04 = ~z~Alright.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_05 = ~z~All yours.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_06 = ~z~A bargain.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_07 = ~z~Excellent.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_08 = ~z~Very good.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_09 = ~z~Always useful.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_10 = ~z~Enjoy.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_11 = ~z~You got it.

TRAPP_ITEMPURCH_12 = ~z~A wise purchase.

TRAPP_JAVELINA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~You can never know a horse too well.~sl:~My Appaloosa Oakley saved my life more than once out in the field.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_01 = ~z~My word, you don't see one of those every day.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_02 = ~z~Well, you look pleased with yourself, and rightly so.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_03 = ~z~Oh, you certainly know how to make an old man happy, don't you?

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_04 = ~z~Now, that is a thing of true beauty. I knew I could rely on you.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_05 = ~z~Look at that. Well done.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_06 = ~z~Oh my, that is impressive. Very impressive.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_07 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Wow, that's a once-in-a-lifetime kill you bagged there.~sl:~I'm proud of you.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_08 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Would you look at that! Excellent hunting.~sl:~Keep this up, we'll both be rolling in money by the end of the year.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_09 = ~z~My God, what a specimen! Good work. I'm very impressed.

TRAPP_LEGENDANI_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Well, well. The rumors were true after all.~sl:0.4~What a majestic creature.

TRAPP_LOWHONOR_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Well, you have been making quite a name for yourself.~sl:~Remind me to stay on your good side.

TRAPP_LOWHONOR_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Just so you know, I'm not a man to judge.~sl:~Whatever they're saying about you out there.

TRAPP_LOWHONOR_03 = ~z~~sl:0.4:2.3~I've been hearing some rumors about you...~sl:~but you don't have a problem with old Gus, right?

TRAPP_LOWHONOR_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Uh-oh, it's the cold-blooded killer...~sl:0.6~hope you've managed to bag a few with four legs along the way.

TRAPP_NEGEMOTE_01 = ~z~I'd do that back, but I'm not twelve years old.

TRAPP_NEGEMOTE_02 = ~z~Is that meant to intimidate me?

TRAPP_NEGEMOTE_03 = ~z~Oh, don't be an idiot.

TRAPP_NEGEMOTE_04 = ~z~Oh, cut it out. What are you trying to prove?

TRAPP_NEWANIMA1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~So, I've been hearing rumors about an animal,~sl:~a very unique example within its species, by all accounts.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA1_2 = ~z~Sounds like it could be worth a lot of money.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Okay, I need you back on the hunt.~sl:0.5~There have been some sightings of an animal, extremely rare in appearance.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA2_2 = ~z~Hopefully you can get to it before our competitors do.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Good timing. Another rare animal's been spotted.~sl:~A majestic specimen, if the rumors are to be believed.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA3_2 = ~z~I imagine it will attract other hunters, so move fast.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~Alright...~sl:~I just got word of some sightings not too far from here...

TRAPP_NEWANIMA4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~an animal apparently very unique in appearance and stature.~sl:~Sounds like the perfect prize for us.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~You are just in time.~sl:0.5:2.5~Some more rare fauna has been spotted.~sl:0.4~Can you get out there and track it down for me?

TRAPP_NEWANIMA5_2 = ~z~Sounds like it could be worth a tidy sum.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA6_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Okay, I have another creature for you to track down.~sl:~A very rare and striking specimen, and quite elusive.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA6_2 = ~z~But nothing too elusive for Team Macmillan, am I right?

TRAPP_NEWANIMA7_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~So, I've been hearing stories about this one particular animal,~sl:~quite legendary now among the locals, it seems.

TRAPP_NEWANIMA7_2 = ~z~I was thinking maybe you should head over there to take a look?

TRAPP_NEWANIMA8_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Have you been hearing about these sightings?~sl:0.5~An entirely new variant within its species?

TRAPP_NEWANIMA8_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~If the rumors are true,~sl:~I think you should hotfoot it over there as soon as possible.

TRAPP_NROLECUT_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~You'll have to forgive me, I'm a little busy.~sl:~I have to leave for Strawberry very soon.

TRAPP_NROLECUT_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Sorry, I can't talk right now. I'm late with the mayor's panther.~sl:~Don't ask, it's a long story.

TRAPP_PLAYSHOOT_01 = ~z~What are you doing? Save those for hunting!

TRAPP_PLAYSHOOT_02 = ~z~What the hell are you shooting at?

TRAPP_PLAYSHOOT_03 = ~z~Hey, stop showing off!

TRAPP_PLAYSHOOT_04 = ~z~Hey, go practice somewhere else!

TRAPP_PLAYWANT_01 = ~z~Sorry, the last thing I need is any problems with the law.

TRAPP_PLAYWANT_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I think we should avoid any business~sl:~while the law's on your tail, don't you?

TRAPP_PLAYWANT_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Sorry, I don't know you.~sl:~At least I don't so long as the law's looking for you.

TRAPP_POSEMOTE_01 = ~z~You're certainly a live one, aren't you?

TRAPP_POSEMOTE_02 = ~z~You're in a good mood.

TRAPP_POSEMOTE_03 = ~z~I'd put that energy into some hunting if I were you.

TRAPP_POSEMOTE_04 = ~z~Have you been drinking? That makes two of us.

TRAPP_RAMHORN_1 = ~z~This should help some of those plants go a little further.

TRAPP_REPEATPUR_01 = ~z~Can't get enough of this, can you?

TRAPP_REPEATPUR_02 = ~z~You know what you like, don't you?

TRAPP_REPEATPUR_03 = ~z~And another? I'll need to make sure I keep this in supply.

TRAPP_REPEATPUR_04 = ~z~You're really stocking up on that, huh?

TRAPP_SNOWYEG_1 = ~z~Always wise to look after your horse's wellbeing.

TRAPP_SPRAYED_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Oh, that smell...~sl:~that witch Harriet sprayed you with one of her potions, didn't she?

TRAPP_SPRAYED_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Uh... I could smell you from half a mile away,~sl:~Miss Davenport doused you in one of her potions, didn't she?

TRAPP_SPRAYED_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Oh no, I'd know that stench anywhere.~sl:~The Harriet spritz. Didn't I tell you to stay away from that crazy shrew?
