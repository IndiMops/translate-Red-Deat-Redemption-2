CFCNU_ACT_1 = ~z~How you keeping?

CFCNU_ACT_2 = ~z~I'm keeping.

CFCNU_ACT_3 = ~z~I like that... big, tough, taciturn.

CFCNU_ACT_4 = ~z~Yes, that's the word, taciturn.

CFCNU_ACT_5 = ~z~Is it? I don't know what it means.

CFCNU_ACT_6 = ~z~Well... kinda means big and tough, and...

CFCNU_ACT_7 = ~z~hiding how dumb you are by not saying much.

CFCNU_ACT_8 = ~z~That's me.

CFCNU_ACT_9 = ~z~Oh, it doesn't have to be.

CFCNU_ACT_10 = ~z~If the choice is folks thinking I'm dumb but not knowing for sure,

CFCNU_ACT_11 = ~z~and folks knowing I'm dumb because I sound like you,

CFCNU_ACT_12 = ~z~

CFCNU_ACT_13 = ~z~I think I'd rather keep them wondering.

CFCNU_ACT_14 = ~z~I see what you did there, mighty clever. You know, maybe you ain't so dumb.

CFCNU_ACT_15 = ~z~In that case, you'll say something.

CFCNU_ACT_16 = ~z~Say what?

CFCNU_ACT_17 = ~z~I don't know... if I knew, I'd say it.

CFCNU_ACT_18 = ~z~Maybe it just don't need to be said, ever think of that?

CFCNU_ACT_19 = ~z~Maybe... maybe silence is okay.

CFCNU_ACT_20 = ~z~Silence... silence, I've got enough time for silence. It's called eternity.

CFCNU_ACT_21 = ~z~I'm starting to understand eternity a little better, it's going to be a lot like this conversation.

CFCNU_ACT_22 = ~z~You are a very boring man, Charles Smith. You know that?

CFCNU_ACT_23 = ~z~So you keep telling me.

CFCNU_ACT_24 = ~z~
