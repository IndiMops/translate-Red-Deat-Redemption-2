GFH_TRE_INT_15 = ~z~But I need your help.

GFH_TRE_INT_16 = ~z~It's perfectly legal.

GFH_TRE_INT_17 = ~z~Well, that's a fib, it should be perfectly legal.

GFH_TRE_INT_18 = ~z~It's horseflesh.

GFH_TRE_INT_19 = ~z~Valuable horseflesh owned by awful people.

GFH_TRE_INT_20 = ~z~Mrs. Catherine Braithwaite, wretched person...

GFH_TRE_INT_21 = ~z~owns a wonderful horse.

GFH_TRE_INT_22 = ~z~And I know someone who will pay top dollar for it...

GFH_TRE_INT_24 = ~z~and deliver it to these funny horse traders in Scarlett Meadows.

GFH_TRE_INT_25 = ~z~Well, is that a yes?

GFH_TRE_INT_26 = ~z~Well, off you go then.

GFH_TRE_INT_27 = ~z~Bon voyage.

MGTRE_CE_BRT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~It's a pal of mine.~sl:0.0:5.4~He's taking some wagons to Braithwaite Manor and needs a little security.~sl:~Only, well, I'm... sure it's legal, but...

MGTRE_CE_BRT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~it's probably not entirely legal, so... I thought of you.~sl:~Should be, uh... lots of fun.

MGTRE_DS_CALI_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~So, I need you to cause some trouble for me.~sl:0.5:2.6~Just... wanton destruction.~sl:0.2~It's those rotters at Caliga Hall.

MGTRE_G3_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~I just got sent this thing...~sl:1.4~take a read and... see what you think.

MGTRE_G3_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~I was thinking it was just your sort of thing...~sl:0.7:1.9~but maybe you disagree.

MGTRE_JB_AMUBG_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.3~Ah, good... so, this is a job that came across my path...~sl:0.2~I think you'll, well...

MGTRE_JB_AMUBG_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~it's wanton vandalism, but what could be more delightful~sl:~than wanton vandalism?

MGTRE_JB_AMUBG_3 = ~z~I need you to go and destroy a shipment of ammunition.

MGTRE_JB_AMUBG_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~It's over in Bolger Glade~sl:~and belongs to one of the most loathesome people

MGTRE_JB_DELIV_2 = ~z~Take the mailbag, the addresses are on the letters.

MGTRE_JB_DELIV_3 = ~z~It's, uh, for a special friend of mine.

MGTRE_JB_DELIV_4 = ~z~Special in that they're very rich and reasonably shady...

MGTRE_JB_DELIV_5 = ~z~and they pay well... so... please make it work.

MGTRE_JB_LETRET_1 = ~z~Ah...

MGTRE_JB_LGWAG_1 = ~z~So, I think, well... I hope you'll even enjoy this.

MGTRE_JB_LGWAG_2 = ~z~It certainly pays well... and it's just a little delivery job. Completely legal...

MGTRE_JB_LGWAG_3 = ~z~as... far as you're concerned, at least, as you don't know any better...

MGTRE_JB_LGWAG_4 = ~z~just escort my good friend's wagon from here to Lagras.

MGTRE_OH_CIVIL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Noble beasts...~sl:0.3~but they'll rip your throat out and eat your sheep.

MGTRE_OH_CIVIL_3 = ~z~So a farmer I know is paying well for the head of this wolf near Bolger Glade.

MGTRE_OH_CIVIL_4 = ~z~Maybe you could hunt and destroy it, hm?

MGTRE_OH_SDW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.2~So, reptiles... cold-hearted killers in beautiful costumes,~sl:~it's the tale of America.

MGTRE_OH_SDW_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~And we can tell how that story ends.~sl:0.2:2.9~With everyone dead in a bloody mess...~sl:1.0~I'm talking shit of course...

MGTRE_OH_SDW_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~But perhaps you'd like to hunt this beast,~sl:0.0:3.9~in Bluewater Marsh, he's been, uh...~sl:~eating the locals.

MGTRE_RB_CALI_1 = ~z~Ah, so, I think... this may even be rather fun... and certainly morally justified.

MGTRE_RB_CALI_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~You know, it's just a little light robbery...~sl:0.2:3.0~from those imbeciles, the Grays.~sl:0.2~Rowing boats, that's what we want from them.

MGTRE_RB_CALI_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.9~You're going to steal them and it's going to bother the hell out of them.~sl:~Which, to be honest, I rather like.

MGTRE_RB_CLEM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~Hmm, well... so this is a thing that just came my way...~sl:0.2~poof, just like that.

MGTRE_RB_CLEM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well, it's thieving of course,~sl:~but there's nothing wrong with thieving, now, is there?

MGTRE_RB_CLEM_3 = ~z~I need you to steal some boats from the Clemens Point jetty.

MGTRE_RB_CLEM_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~They belong to one of the worst people I've ever pick pocketed and~sl:0.3:1.3~quite frankly...~sl:0.5:4.0~this is letting the scoundrel off lightly.~sl:1.0~Got it? Great. Good.

MGTRE_RB_MACM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Well, well...~sl:0.4:5.7~I need you to steal me some boats... yes, some boats.~sl:0.0:1.9~I know, I know.~sl:0.0:2.7~People don't take too kindly to that,~sl:~but be so good as to hear me out.

MGTRE_RB_MACM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~They're at Macomb's End on the Kamassa River.~sl:~The owner really offended a lady I know.

MGTRE_RB_MACM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~I will not let anyone speak that way to a woman.~sl:0.5:2.4~Besides which, you know,~sl:0.0:3.2~we can always make good money selling the boats.~sl:0.9:1.6:1~Away you go, then.

MGTRE_RV_LON_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.3~So, I need you to rescue some chaps for me. Been taken hostage.~sl:~Kidnapped for money, I believe.

MGTRE_RV_LON_2 = ~z~And apparently being held in Lonnie's Shack.

MGTRE_RV_LON_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~It's those bloody Lemoyne Raiders.~sl:0.0:5.5~They never seem to tire of this... childish nonsense.~sl:3.1~Off you go, then.

MGTRE_RV_WSM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.1~So, I need you to rescue a friend of a friend.~sl:0.2~Taken hostage, they were...

MGTRE_RV_WSM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.0~by those military-minded morons, the Lemoyne Raiders.~sl:0.3~Don't know the details. I just got asked to help.

MGTRE_RV_WSM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~But I believe they're somewhere south of Caliga Hall.~sl:1.2~There you have it.

MGTRE_RW_BRT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Ah, so, these buggers...~sl:0.3~well, they robbed my pal. Robbed him blind, blind.

MGTRE_RW_BRT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.3~Took his wagon and took his dignity... out-bloody-rageous.~sl:0.5~We cannot stand for that. Can we? No we cannot.

MGTRE_RW_BRT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.2~Go rob it back from them. It was the bloody Braithwaites I believe.~sl:1.0~They're the bloody worst.

MGTRE_RW_SBLLE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~Good... so this is a job that got sent my way...~sl:0.3:2.4~I think you'll... well...~sl:~it's highway robbery.

MGTRE_RW_SBLLE_2 = ~z~And what could be more fun than that? Very little, right?

MGTRE_RW_SBLLE_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~I need you to go and steal back a stagecoach.~sl:~It's over in Shady Belle and I believe...

MGTRE_RW_SBLLE_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~loaded to the gills with goodies, it is.~sl:0.2:2.2~Belonging to those creepy blighters~sl:~who are still fighting a silly war.

MGTRE_RW_SBLLE_5 = ~z~Rob them blind for me, will you? Thank you very much.

MGTRE_SH_BRT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~So I think... well, I hope,~sl:~you'll be rather good at this, it should make you a few bucks.

MGTRE_SH_BRT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~It's just horse thieving... nothing serious... I mean,~sl:0.7~they hang you for it, but the criminal justice system is for barbarians...

MGTRE_SH_BRT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.8~Go to Braithwaite Manor and pinch some of that hag's nag's.~sl:0.6~She deserves it, trust me.

MGTRE_SH_CALI_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~So, this could be fun,~sl:0.6~well I hope so, at least... and pay you pretty well.

MGTRE_SH_CALI_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.3~It's horse thieving... I know it's illegal and often immoral, but~sl:~in this instance, the victims are absolute rotters...
