RH0_AMB_FCMBT_1 = ~z~You ain't leaving alive this time!

RH0_AMB_FWARN1_1 = ~z~You got the goddamn audacity to come back here after what you did?

RH0_AMB_FWARN2_1 = ~z~You get the hell off my property, you thieving son of a bitch!

RH0_AMB_FWARN3_1 = ~z~This is your last warning!

RH0_AMB_SDEAD_1 = ~z~What the hell? I'm gonna kill you! You murdered my son!

RH0_ARRIVE_1 = ~z~Okay, let's take a quick look at the place...

RH0_ARRIVE_DAY_1 = ~z~Anyone around?

RH0_ARRIVE_DAY_2 = ~z~Yes. Okay... I reckon we can do it now...

RH0_ARRIVE_DAY_3 = ~z~I'll head over, distract 'em by putting on a little show while you sneak into the house, find what you can...

RH0_ARRIVE_DAY_4 = ~z~then get the stage coach.

RH0_ARRIVE_NGHT_1 = ~z~See anyone?

RH0_ARRIVE_NGHT_2 = ~z~Nope. Okay... I reckon we could do it now.

RH0_ARRIVE_NGHT_3 = ~z~Sneak in, I'll get the coach, you can try the house.

RH0_CMBT_BCK_1 = ~z~Behind the house! You see him?

RH0_CMBT_BDOOR_1 = ~z~One of them's coming out the back!

RH0_CMBT_FDOOR_1 = ~z~There's one coming out the front door!

RH0_CMBT_FRNT_1 = ~z~Watch him in front of the house!

RH0_CMBT_HELP_1 = ~z~Help me out here, Arthur!

RH0_CMBT_INSDE_1 = ~z~We got shots coming from inside!

RH0_CMBT_LFT_1 = ~z~Left side of the house!

RH0_CMBT_OVER_1 = ~z~Was that really necessary, Arthur?

RH0_CMBT_OVER_2 = ~z~If I had a dollar for every time I've been asked that.

RH0_CMBT_RT_1 = ~z~Right of the house! Look out!

RH0_CMBT_SPOT_1 = ~z~I told you to stay hidden, Arthur.

RH0_CMBT_STARTB_1 = ~z~Damn it, they're onto us!

RH0_CMBT_START_1 = ~z~Damn it, Arthur, warn me before you open fire!

RH0_CMBT_WGN1_1 = ~z~Keep driving, I'll hold them off!

RH0_CMBT_WGN2_1 = ~z~We just want the coach, back the hell off or we'll kill you both!

RH0_CMBT_WGN3_1 = ~z~Keep going Arthur, let's get out of here!

RH0_CRD_HTCH1_01 = ~z~Leave your horse near these trees over here.

RH0_CRD_HTCH1_02 = ~z~What are you doing? Get off, come on.

RH0_CRD_HTCH1_03 = ~z~You heard me, didn't you? We should go on foot.

RH0_CRD_SCPE0_1 = ~z~Let's see what we're dealing with, come on.

RH0_CRD_SCPE1_1 = ~z~There's the house.

RH0_CRD_SCPE1_2 = ~z~I see the barn in the back, stagecoach has to be in there.

RH0_DAY_APRCH0A_1 = ~z~I guess we're just going straight at it then!

RH0_DAY_APRCH0A_2 = ~z~See what you can find in the house while I distract them out front.

RH0_DAY_APRCH0B_1 = ~z~I guess we're just going straight at it then!

RH0_DAY_APRCH0B_2 = ~z~See what you can find in the house and I'll deal with the stage coach.

RH0_DAY_APRCH1_1 = ~z~Don't follow me, go around to the side of the house so no one sees you.

RH0_DAY_APRCH2_1 = ~z~Arthur, did you not hear me?

RH0_DAY_APRCH2_2 = ~z~Sneak around the back and see what you can find in the house while I distract them.

RH0_DAY_APRCH3_1 = ~z~Go on, damn it. Before you get spotted.

RH0_DAY_APRCH4_1 = ~z~Well, I ain't doing this until you get away from me.

RH0_DAY_APRCHFR_1 = ~z~No, not the front, go around the back.

RH0_DAY_INSDE_1 = ~z~That was really strange, Pa.

RH0_DAY_INSDE_2 = ~z~Yeah, I don't know who's more of a fool... me or him.

RH0_DAY_INSDE_3 = ~z~How's your back feel?

RH0_DAY_INSDE_4 = ~z~Worse, I think.

RH0_DAY_SPTFRA_1 = ~z~You again? You're done this time!

RH0_DAY_SPTFR_1 = ~z~What the hell are you doing in here? You bastard!

RH0_DAY_SPTSN_1 = ~z~What the hell you doing on our property?

RH0_DRIVEBACK_1 = ~z~This was easier than hunting a thousand-pound grizzly anyway.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_2 = ~z~~sl:0.6~No doubt. I won't forget that in a hurry.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_3 = ~z~I'm looking forward to your retelling of that one around the campfire.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_4 = ~z~~sl:1.1~“It wasn't the first time Mr. Matthews had stared death in the eye, and as usual he did not flinch”.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_5 = ~z~Exactly. So how long you think we're gonna stick around here for?

RH0_DRIVEBACK_6 = ~z~Not sure. Until we can't, I suppose.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_7 = ~z~Feels like we're starting to get back on our feet, slowly but surely. Just need to keep at it.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_8 = ~z~Dutch has a new money chest stashed in a safe spot away from camp, but it's a long way from being full.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_9 = ~z~I hope it's not stashed in town like we did in Blackwater...

RH0_DRIVEBACK_10 = ~z~Even if we had to dump the money from the ferry, we could've at least got the rest out if it was hidden someplace else.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_11 = ~z~No, I think we've learned our lesson there. And a few other lessons, besides.

RH0_DRIVEBACK_12 = ~z~I hope so, but, I ain't so sure about that...

RH0_ENT_WGN1B_1 = ~z~You done, Arthur?

RH0_ENT_WGN1B_2 = ~z~Yep.

RH0_ENT_WGN1B_3 = ~z~Okay. Let's grab this stagecoach and get out of here.

RH0_ENT_WGN1C_1 = ~z~You done? Anything good in there?

RH0_ENT_WGN1C_2 = ~z~Er, I didn't actually make it inside in the end, was too busy watching your show.

RH0_ENT_WGN1C_3 = ~z~Christ, Arthur. Well too late now, let's just grab the stagecoach and go then.

RH0_ENT_WGN1_1 = ~z~You done, Arthur?

RH0_ENT_WGN1_2 = ~z~Yep. Covered my tracks so well they won't ever know I was in there.

RH0_ENT_WGN1_3 = ~z~Good work. Let's grab this stagecoach and get out of here.

RH0_ENT_WGN2_1 = ~z~Okay. Let's grab this stagecoach and get out of here.

RH0_FR_RCT_ATK_1 = ~z~Get your damn hands off my boy!

RH0_FR_RCT_DEAD_1 = ~z~Not my boy!

RH0_FR_RCT_DEAD_2 = ~z~You're going to pay, you bastard!

RH0_IG2_ROB2_1 = ~z~Who are you?

RH0_IG2_ROB2_2 = ~z~Junior! We're being tricked... shoot this bastard!

RH0_IG2_ROB_1 = ~z~What's that noise?

RH0_IG2_ROB_2 = ~z~Junior we're being robbed, shoot this bastard!

RH0_JR_HOGTIED_01 = ~z~~sl:0.6~You won't get away with this.

RH0_JR_HOGTIED_02 = ~z~~sl:1.3~You don't know who you're messing with.

RH0_JR_HOGTIED_03 = ~z~~sl:0.7~Let me go, you bastard.

RH0_JR_HOGTIED_04 = ~z~~sl:1.5~You picked the wrong house to rob, mark my words.

RH0_LEAVE_NOWB_1 = ~z~We need to get out of here.

RH0_LEAVE_NOW_1 = ~z~Let's get the stagecoach, we need to leave now.

RH0_LVE_THRT_1 = ~z~If you come after us, you're dead!

RH0_LVE_THRT_2 = ~z~You hear me?

RH0_MCS1_1 = ~z~Or...

RH0_MCS1_2 = ~z~wait until nightfall.

RH0_MCS1_3 = ~z~Sneak in, then I'll get the coach.

RH0_MCS1_4 = ~z~You can try the house.

RH0_MCS1_5 = ~z~What do you think?

RH0_MCS1_6 = ~z~Let's do it now.

RH0_MCS1_7 = ~z~Sure.

RH0_MCS1_8 = ~z~Alright then...

RH0_MCS1_9 = ~z~don't follow me.

RH0_MCS1_10 = ~z~Let's wait.

RH0_MCS1_11 = ~z~Okay, let's go.

RH0_MCS1_12 = ~z~Sure.

RH0_MCS1_13 = ~z~You go into the house...

RH0_MCS1_14 = ~z~I'll go find this wagon.

RH0_MCS1_15 = ~z~Or...

RH0_MCS1_16 = ~z~wait until morning, when I'll head over...

RH0_MCS1_17 = ~z~distract them by putting on a little show...

RH0_MCS1_18 = ~z~while you sneak into the house, find what you can, and...

RH0_MCS1_19 = ~z~then get the stagecoach.

RH0_MCS1_20 = ~z~What do you think?

RH0_MCS1_21 = ~z~Let's do it now.

RH0_MCS1_22 = ~z~Alright.

RH0_MCS1_23 = ~z~I reckon we're ready.

RH0_MCS1_24 = ~z~Let's go.

RH0_MCS1_25 = ~z~Okay...

RH0_MCS1_26 = ~z~let's get on with this, Mr. Morgan.

RH0_MCS1_27 = ~z~Yes.

RH0_MCS1_28 = ~z~Let me head up there and make a fool of myself.

RH0_MCS1_29 = ~z~With pleasure.

RH0_MCS1_30 = ~z~Just don't get caught...

RH0_MCS1_31 = ~z~because it's me they'll shoot first.

RH0_MCS1_BINO_2_1 = ~z~You've got binoculars, don't you?

RH0_MCS1_BINO_3_1 = ~z~Will you get your binoculars out so we can scan this place together? We don't want any surprises.

RH0_MCS1_CALL_1_1 = ~z~Arthur, get over here.

RH0_MCS1_CALL_2_1 = ~z~Come here, what is with you today?

RH0_MCS1_CALL_3_1 = ~z~Hey, come on. Let's take a look first.

RH0_MCS1_CALL_4_1 = ~z~Get over here before someone spots you.

RH0_MCS1_CALL_5_1 = ~z~Arthur, what are you doing over there?

RH0_MCS1_CALL_6_1 = ~z~Let's scope it out. What are you doing?

RH0_MCS2_1 = ~z~Hello, Seamus.

RH0_MCS2_2 = ~z~We met your cousins.

RH0_MCS2_3 = ~z~How was it?

RH0_MCS2_4 = ~z~Fine, nice people.

RH0_MCS2_5 = ~z~Park that thing in here...

RH0_MCS2_6 = ~z~quickly.

RH0_MCS2_7 = ~z~Nice work, Hosea.

RH0_MCS2_8 = ~z~It was mostly Arthur.

RH0_MCS2_9 = ~z~Like I said, coarse, but competent.

RH0_MCS2_10 = ~z~Here.

RH0_MCS2_11 = ~z~Thank you.

RH0_MCS2_12 = ~z~If you find any other coaches that need selling...

RH0_MCS2_13 = ~z~I'll see what I can offer you for them.

RH0_MCS2_14 = ~z~But discreet, you know?

RH0_MCS2_15 = ~z~Of course.

RH0_MCS2_LI_1 = ~z~Hello, Seamus... we met your cousins.

RH0_MCS2_LI_2 = ~z~How was it?

RH0_MCS2_LI_3 = ~z~Fine... nice people.

RH0_MCS2_LI_4 = ~z~

RH0_MCS2_LI_5 = ~z~Park that thing in here... quickly.

RH0_MCS2_LO1_1 = ~z~Goodbye, gentlemen.

RH0_MCS2_LO1_2 = ~z~I'm heading back to camp, I think. You coming?

RH0_MCS2_LO2_1 = ~z~Sure.

RH0_NGT_FR_SLPA_1 = ~z~

RH0_NGT_FR_SLPB_1 = ~z~

RH0_NGT_LEAVEH1_1 = ~z~I can handle this, Arthur. Go on.

RH0_NGT_LEAVEH2_1 = ~z~What's the problem here? Just leave me to it and get inside that house.

RH0_NGT_NOISE1_1 = ~z~Hey! What are you doing? Keep it down.

RH0_NGT_NOISE2_1 = ~z~You trying to get us caught?

RH0_NGT_NOISE3_1 = ~z~Goddamn it, Arthur. Stop making such a racket.

RH0_NGT_SN_SLPA_1 = ~z~

RH0_NGT_SN_SLPB_1 = ~z~

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_1 = ~z~Could have played that better, couldn't you?

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_2 = ~z~Thought you wanted me here to show some strong arm? That's usually how it goes.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_3 = ~z~Yes, but... you know how this works.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_4 = ~z~C'mon, Hosea. That feller's a joke.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_5 = ~z~And that's why he's perfect. He won't cause us any problems.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_6 = ~z~A safe spot to fence wagons and coaches, that's easy money for us.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_7 = ~z~I guess you're right.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_8 = ~z~Come on, it's not like he's asking us to rob a bank.

RH0_RIDE_CRD0_9 = ~z~If the two of us can't steal a stagecoach from Seamus' old crooked cousin by marriage, we should hang up our hats now.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1SHOUTED_10 = ~z~There's a couple folks, I wish, had cut and run.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1SPOKEN_10 = ~z~There's a couple of folks, I wish, had cut and run.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_1 = ~z~How you feeling about things now?

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_2 = ~z~What things?

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_3 = ~z~This place, the gang... been here a few weeks now.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_4 = ~z~Good, I think. Better.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_5 = ~z~I figured more folks would have cut and run on us, given everything that happened.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_6 = ~z~Like Dutch always says, a lone wolf don't last long out on the plains.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_7 = ~z~He does like to trot that one out.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_8 = ~z~People see that, especially when they get a few years on them.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_9 = ~z~Even someone like Micah.

RH0_RIDE_CRD1_11 = ~z~Maybe they'd say the same about you.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2SHOUTED_4 = ~z~There's something strange about the place.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2SPOKEN_4 = ~z~Something strange about the place.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_1 = ~z~So what's the story with that Emerald Ranch? You find out anything else?

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_2 = ~z~A little. Owner's a nasty type, by all accounts. Seamus is sure scared of him.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_3 = ~z~That's not saying much.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_5 = ~z~Used to be a saloon there, general store. Now it's all closed up, but they seem to have money.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_6 = ~z~Sounds worth a look around.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_7 = ~z~For sure...

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_8 = ~z~Seamus also mentioned the rancher's daughter a couple of times,

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_9 = ~z~how he used to see her around all the time but now she never leaves the house.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_10 = ~z~Probably just sweet on her.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_11 = ~z~That what you call finding out a little?

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_12 = ~z~Once he opens up, seems Seamus does like to talk.

RH0_RIDE_CRD2_13 = ~z~Hopefully not too much.

RH0_RIDE_HERE_1 = ~z~Hey, let's keep it down now. We must be close.

RH0_RIDE_LOOK_1 = ~z~That must be the place up ahead. We should go on foot from here.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT1_1 = ~z~Really?

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT1_2 = ~z~Really.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT2_01 = ~z~Just get on the horse.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT2_02 = ~z~It'll be fun, I promise.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT2_03 = ~z~Arthur? Let's go.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT3_1 = ~z~Lead the way. He said the place is just northwest of here.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT3_2 = ~z~Me?

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT3_3 = ~z~You're the one who's been out gallivanting around here.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT3_4 = ~z~That's what you call it.

RH0_RIDE_MOUNT3_5 = ~z~Clearly you've recovered from your bear encounter.

RH0_RTCMP_NEG_1 = ~z~No, I'll catch up with you later.

RH0_RTCMP_NEG_2 = ~z~Okay, stay out of trouble.

RH0_RTRN_BRN_1 = ~z~Okay, here we are. Just pull the coach into the barn there.

RH0_RTRN_CMBT1_1 = ~z~Damn it, Arthur, why did you start that?

RH0_RTRN_CMBT1_2 = ~z~Just wanted to get this done with.

RH0_RTRN_CMBT1_3 = ~z~And I wanted this done quiet and simple, but there we go.

RH0_RTRN_CMBT1_4 = ~z~Let's just get back to Emerald Ranch and finish things up.

RH0_RTRN_COOL_1 = ~z~Shit, there's a man coming.

RH0_RTRN_COOL_2 = ~z~Just play it cool, he might not know the situation here.

RH0_RTRN_KLL1_1 = ~z~We could have done this without killing anyone.

RH0_RTRN_KLL1_2 = ~z~It worked out, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_KLL1_3 = ~z~That's not the point. It might not have...

RH0_RTRN_KLL1_4 = ~z~what if there were more people around we didn't know about?

RH0_RTRN_KLL1_5 = ~z~We'd have dealt with them too.

RH0_RTRN_KLL1_6 = ~z~Alright, fine, it's done now. Let's just get back to Emerald Ranch and turn this in.

RH0_RTRN_LOST_1 = ~z~I think we should be okay now, we're far enough away.

RH0_RTRN_NOISE_1 = ~z~What are you making a noise for?

RH0_RTRN_NOISE_2 = ~z~Just get on the coach and let's go.

RH0_RTRN_QUICK1_1 = ~z~Come on, let's get out of here before the law shows up!

RH0_RTRN_QUICK2_1 = ~z~Get on, Arthur. We don't have time to mess around here.

RH0_RTRN_QUICK3_1 = ~z~Crack that whip, come on. We need to get moving!

RH0_RTRN_QUICK4_1 = ~z~Faster, Arthur! Come on!

RH0_RTRN_ROB1_1 = ~z~So what were you able to lift from the house?

RH0_RTRN_ROB2A_1 = ~z~Found some money stashed away. Must be a few hundred. Not too bad.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2A_2 = ~z~Not bad at all.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2B_1 = ~z~A few bits and pieces, nothing too fancy.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2B_2 = ~z~Well we need anything we can get right now.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2C_1 = ~z~Didn't see anything worth taking.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2C_2 = ~z~Nothing? We need whatever we can get right now. Oh well.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2D_1 = ~z~Er, I didn't actually make it inside, I was too busy watching your show.

RH0_RTRN_ROB2D_2 = ~z~What? I was supposed to be distracting them, not you!

RH0_RTRN_ROB2D_3 = ~z~What can I say? You ain't lost it yet.

RH0_RTRN_SEEN1_1 = ~z~Damn it, he's going for the law. Do something!

RH0_RTRN_SEEN2_1 = ~z~You have to stop him! Use your talents, Arthur!

RH0_RTRN_SEEN3_1 = ~z~Arthur, what are you waiting for? It's now or never. Get after him!

RH0_RTRN_SPOT_1 = ~z~Damn it, they must had spotted us riding out.

RH0_RTRN_SPOT_2 = ~z~Guess I should've tried leaving the back way.

RH0_RTRN_SPOT_3 = ~z~Too late now.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL1_1 = ~z~Nicely done, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL1_2 = ~z~Yes, and I only had to put one of them down.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL1_3 = ~z~Arthur... I wanted this clean and simple.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL1_4 = ~z~Okay, probably best we don't relay that news to Seamus.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL2_1 = ~z~Nicely done, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL2_2 = ~z~Yeah... just one thing. I had to kill them both, unfortunately.

RH0_RTRN_STKIL2_3 = ~z~Arthur, for Christ's sake!

RH0_RTRN_STKIL2_4 = ~z~I wanted this clean and simple. Okay, probably best we don't relay that news to Seamus.

RH0_RTRN_STKO1_1 = ~z~Nicely done, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_STKO1_2 = ~z~One of them spotted me, but he ain't going nowhere for a while.

RH0_RTRN_STKO1_3 = ~z~Dammit, Arthur. Okay, well, let's just get back to Emerald Ranch and finish things up.

RH0_RTRN_STKO2_1 = ~z~Nicely done, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_STKO2_2 = ~z~They both spotted me, but I made sure they ain't going nowhere for a while.

RH0_RTRN_STKO2_3 = ~z~Dammit, Arthur. Okay, well, let's just get back to Emerald Ranch and finish things up.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH1_1 = ~z~Nicely done, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH1_2 = ~z~And I'm pretty sure they never even knew I was there.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH1_3 = ~z~Best way, less problems the better right now.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH1_4 = ~z~Just need to get this back to Seamus in one piece and it's a good day's work.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH2_1 = ~z~Nicely done, we got everything we needed.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH2_2 = ~z~And I'm pretty sure they never even knew I was there.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH2_3 = ~z~Best way, less problems the better right now.

RH0_RTRN_STLTH2_4 = ~z~Just need to get this back to Seamus in one piece and it's a good night's work.

RH0_RTRN_STOLE2_1 = ~z~Damn it, Arthur, you should have been more careful.

RH0_RTRN_STOLE2_2 = ~z~Yeah, sorry, I must have left a dresser open.

RH0_RTRN_STOLE3_1 = ~z~Damn it, Arthur, you should have been more careful.

RH0_RTRN_STOLE3_2 = ~z~Yeah, sorry, I must have left a drawer open.

RH0_RTRN_STOLE4_1 = ~z~Damn it, Arthur, you should have been more careful.

RH0_RTRN_STOLE4_2 = ~z~Yeah, sorry, I must have left a chest open.

RH0_RTRN_THRTB_1 = ~z~The old Arthur Morgan charm, I think that should keep him quiet...

RH0_RTRN_THRTB_2 = ~z~Come on, let's get going.

RH0_RTRN_THRTC_1 = ~z~Well, I guess he can't tell the law now.

RH0_RTRN_THRTC_2 = ~z~Okay, let's get going.

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_1 = ~z~So, here's something strange.

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_2 = ~z~Seamus was telling me how he also makes these little trinkets for people from animal claws, teeth and the suchlike.

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_3 = ~z~Good luck charms.

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_4 = ~z~What? Like a rabbit's foot?

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_5 = ~z~I suppose, but, he was claiming they really do work.

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_6 = ~z~Don't they all...

RH0_RTRN_TRNKT_7 = ~z~Oh ye of little faith.

RH0_RTRN_WAIT1_1 = ~z~Hey, wait for me to get on!

RH0_RTRN_WAIT2_1 = ~z~Where are you going? I need to get on!

RH0_RTRN_WAIT3_1 = ~z~Stop, damn it! This isn't funny now!

RH0_RTRN_WGN1_1 = ~z~Come on, get on and let's head back.

RH0_RTRN_WGN2_1 = ~z~Just waiting on you Arthur.

RH0_RTRN_WGN3_1 = ~z~What, are you playing? Just get on the damn coach.

RH0_RTRN_WGNLNG_1 = ~z~What took you so long? I've been waiting here for ages.

RH0_SNK_CALL_A_1 = ~z~Wake up, boy, we got an intruder!

RH0_SNK_CALL_B_1 = ~z~Pa! There's someone in the house!

RH0_SNK_CALL_C_1 = ~z~You're that bastard that was here before! I'll kill you!

RH0_SNK_SND_A_1 = ~z~Huh? Who the hell is that?

RH0_SNK_SND_B_1 = ~z~~sl:1.4~W-what the hell is going on?

RH0_SNK_WNDW_A1_1 = ~z~Maybe take a peek through the windows before you go in, make sure it's all quiet.

RH0_SN_RCT_ATK_1 = ~z~Hey! Don't you touch my Pa!

RH0_SN_RCT_DEAD_1 = ~z~Pa! No!

RH0_SN_RCT_DEAD_2 = ~z~You're a goddamn dead man!

RH0_SON_ANGRY_01 = ~z~Hey!

RH0_SON_ANGRY_02 = ~z~What the hell?

RH0_SON_ANGRY_03 = ~z~What are you doing?

RH0_SON_GUN_01 = ~z~You're dead!

RH0_SON_GUN_02 = ~z~Think you can rob us?

RH0_SON_GUN_03 = ~z~You're going in the ground!

RH0_SON_GUN_04 = ~z~I'd start running if I was you!

RH0_SON_GUN_05 = ~z~Goddamn son of a bitch!
