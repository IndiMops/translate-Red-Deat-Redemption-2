COOK_JB_FALLBK4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:7.2~Well, this is not a proud delivery, eh? You have my sympathies.~sl:0.4~But not every batch is destined for greatness.

COOK_JB_FALLBK4_2 = ~z~Well... think of it this way. A painter cannot produce a masterpiece every time.

COOK_JB_FALLBK4_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~The secret is whether you can make the best of a bad situation,~sl:0.4~find a buyer with a palate like Mr. Cripps,

COOK_JB_FALLBK4_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~and sell them whatever piss you have lying around. Bien.~sl:0.9~You understand? Good luck.

COOK_JB_FALLBK5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Bon, let's get this over with, shall we?~sl:0.6:3.8~I am told this buyer does not have a functioning tongue,~sl:0.3~so we can't fail to impress them.

COOK_JB_FALLBK5_2 = ~z~Well, it will be more profitable than giving it to Mr. Cripps, eh?

COOK_JB_GEN2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.2:5.0~Je suis un peu nerveux, comme d'habitude. This...~sl:0.5~is not merely trade for me. This is art.

COOK_JB_GEN3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~I tell you something. Back in France, working with my father,~sl:~we could deliver two hundred bouteilles of Calvados in a single afternoon,

COOK_JB_GEN3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~with only a cigarette for breakfast.~sl:0.4~That was the life of a real bouilleur de cru, eh?

COOK_JB_GEN3_4 = ~z~Well, er, do what you can. I, I, trust in you. Drive well.

COOK_JB_GEN4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~Ah, there you are. I was worried about you.~sl:0.3~Mr. Cripps has been telling me about some of your adventures.

COOK_JB_GEN4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.5~I think it cannot be all true, no? Or perhaps he is drunk.~sl:0.4~Anyway, to business. We have work to do.

COOK_JB_GEN4_3 = ~z~I have arranged a buyer, they are expecting a delivery.

COOK_JB_GEN4_4 = ~t~In French: No, it cannot be true...

COOK_JB_GEN5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.6~Ah, vous revoila. Today my work is complete,~sl:0.2~and your work shall begin.

COOK_JB_GEN5_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.7~I have poured my soul into these jugs, my friend.~sl:0.4~Yes water, yes mash, but also...
