RCHRB_BANTA1_3 = ~z~Like he said... there, Strawberry... could create a lot of opportunities for a man in your line of work.

RCHRB_BANTA1_4 = ~z~I ain't sure about going back to Strawberry after all that Micah business.

RCHRB_BANTA1_5 = ~z~It didn't sound like you left anyone alive to recognize you, so I wouldn't worry too much, dear boy.

RCHRB_BANTA1_6 = ~z~All this trouble... you gentlemen are becoming quite the celebrities, aren't you?

RCHRB_BANTA1_7 = ~z~Soon you'll be on the front of a dime novel... and dead, of course.

RCHRB_BANTA1_8 = ~z~We're hoping to be long gone before that. Dutch has a plan.

RCHRB_BANTR1_1 = ~z~You sure seem to have got about round here.

RCHRB_BANTR1_2 = ~z~You know me,~rp~ I like to make friends in low places.

RCHRB_BANTR1_3 = ~z~How the hell you end up down here anyway?

RCHRB_BANTR1_4 = ~z~I could ask the same of you.~rp~ I have a few commitments over this way... some expenses to meet.

RCHRB_BANTR1_7 = ~z~Shares in a gold mining company. Excellent returns for the investor of a certain financial standing.

RCHRB_BANTR1_16 = ~z~The train station... the clerk there, Alden, is quite a fellow...

RCHRB_DAWDLE_02 = ~z~Are you going to give me my cut, dear boy?

RCHRB_DAWDLE_03 = ~z~Well don't keep my in suspense, how did we do?

RCHRB_DRCMBT_1 = ~z~You ain't gonna get away with this!

RCHRB_EXT_A1_LI_1 = ~z~Well, that didn't go exactly according to plan...

RCHRB_EXT_LI_1 = ~z~Well done, sir...

RCHRB_GHPL_1 = ~z~Help me!

RCHRB_GRAYS3_1 = ~z~Oh I almost forgot. Bill asked me to give you a message to meet him here in town as soon as you can.

RCHRB_GRAYS3_2 = ~z~Something to do with the Grays. I thought I'd nab you first.

RCHRB_GRAYS3_3 = ~z~He did? Okay thanks.

RCHRB_G_1 = ~z~It's a trick! We're being robbed!

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_4 = ~t~In Italian: Slowly, very slowly.

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_5 = ~z~Madam... madam, we should move. The roads, they're not safe.

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_6 = ~z~My good man, they're perfectly safe.

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_7 = ~z~Can we go, please? I got a train to catch.

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_8 = ~z~Why don't you be quiet, you horrible little man.

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_9 = ~z~One more time, from the top.

RCHRB_IG2_P1A_10 = ~z~

RCHRB_POSTARRV_1 = ~z~Here we are. We can hitch up outside. I'll make the introductions, Arthur.

RCHRB_RC1_1 = ~z~Well, I know you think I'm just some effete buffoon.

RCHRB_RC1_2 = ~z~A what?

RCHRB_RC1_3 = ~z~A man of words and not of action...

RCHRB_RC1_4 = ~z~hardly a man at all.

RCHRB_RC1_5 = ~z~Well I think you're as slippery as an eel in an oil slick...

RCHRB_RC1_6 = ~z~but still a man.

RCHRB_RC1_7 = ~z~Because I think I've...

RCHRB_RC1_8 = ~z~I've found something interesting.

RCHRB_RC1_9 = ~z~Yeah?

RCHRB_RC1_10 = ~z~Have you ever robbed a stagecoach?

RCHRB_RC1_11 = ~z~No, never...

RCHRB_RC1_12 = ~z~why who would've even thought...

RCHRB_RC1_13 = ~z~Of course I've robbed a goddamn stagecoach...

RCHRB_RC1_14 = ~z~you know I have.

RCHRB_RC1_15 = ~z~And what's the problem with stagecoaches?

RCHRB_RC1_16 = ~z~The armed men attempting to put a bullet in your head?

RCHRB_RC1_17 = ~z~Not quite...

RCHRB_RC1_18 = ~z~the odds.

RCHRB_RC1_19 = ~z~I mean, is it worth the robbing?

RCHRB_RC1_20 = ~z~Sometimes.

RCHRB_RC1_21 = ~z~I know, but...

RCHRB_RC1_22 = ~z~well, if you'd like to come with me.

RCHRB_RC1_23 = ~z~I can introduce you to a new best friend, and he's...

RCHRB_RC1_24 = ~z~he's going to give you all the decent, robbable stagecoaches a...

RCHRB_RC1_25 = ~z~hot-blooded degenerate could require.

RCHRB_RC1_26 = ~z~Well I could require a whole lot.

RCHRB_RC2_1 = ~z~Call him Arthur.

RCHRB_RC2_2 = ~z~He's one of us...

RCHRB_RC2_3 = ~z~a fellow man of distinction.

RCHRB_RC2_4 = ~z~Okay, well...

RCHRB_RC2_5 = ~z~this is perfect timing.

RCHRB_RC2_6 = ~z~I think you'll like this one, Josiah.

RCHRB_RC2_7 = ~z~It'll be coming south down the river road...

RCHRB_RC2_8 = ~z~through Siltwater Strand.

RCHRB_RC2_9 = ~z~Thank you, Alden.

RCHRB_RC2_10 = ~z~Thank you very much.

RCHRB_RC2_11 = ~z~Oh, and Josiah...

RCHRB_RC2_12 = ~z~if you or Arthur are ever out Strawberry way...

RCHRB_RC2_13 = ~z~ask for my colleague there, feller called Hector.

RCHRB_RC2_14 = ~z~He's also one of the...

RCHRB_RC2_15 = ~z~what did you call us again?

RCHRB_RC2_16 = ~z~Discouraged men, Alden.

RCHRB_RC2_17 = ~z~That's it...

RCHRB_RC2_18 = ~z~discouraged men.

RCHRB_RC2_19 = ~z~I like that.

RCHRB_RC2_20 = ~z~Well, goodbye, Alden...

RCHRB_RC2_21 = ~z~or should I say...

RCHRB_RC2_22 = ~z~adieu.

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_5 = ~z~My Mrs. is a bad woman. A terrible woman.

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_6 = ~z~They often are... but how's work, Alden?

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_7 = ~z~Terrible.

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_8 = ~z~Wages got cut again, they reckon they just invented a new horseless carriage will be the end of us.

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_9 = ~z~~sl:0.4~They've been saying that nonsense since they invented the wheel... the wickedness of bosses...

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_10 = ~z~I know... my comrades here and I are greatly discouraged from the adequate fulfillment of our duty...

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_11 = ~z~A discouraged man is no man at all Alden... no man at all.

RCHRB_RC2_IGA_12 = ~z~My friend Arthur here, has a present for you...

RCHRB_RC2_IGB_1 = ~z~Here...

RCHRB_RC2_IGB_2 = ~z~Ain't you kind, sir.

RCHRB_S1_1 = ~z~You ain't gonna get away with this!

RCHRB_S1_EXT_1 = ~z~Well done, sir.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_2 = ~z~Well done.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_3 = ~z~It was easy.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_4 = ~z~You did all the work.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_5 = ~z~Team work my dear boy, team work.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_6 = ~z~Here you go.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_7 = ~z~Thank you.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_8 = ~z~Oh, jolly good.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_9 = ~z~Go see Alden from time to time.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_10 = ~z~See you soon, Arthur.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_11 = ~z~Well, that didn't go exactly according to plan.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_12 = ~z~How did we do?

RCHRB_S1_EXT_13 = ~z~Well, aside from all the shooting and getting shot at...

RCHRB_S1_EXT_14 = ~z~we did fine.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_15 = ~z~Here.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_16 = ~z~Thank you.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_17 = ~z~Now, go see Alden from time to time.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_18 = ~z~Let's hope it goes a little smoother next time.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_19 = ~z~We always hope that, Arthur.

RCHRB_S1_EXT_20 = ~z~See you soon.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_1 = ~z~Okay, this should do.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_2 = ~z~Sure.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_3 = ~z~Here.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_4 = ~z~I'm hoping we won't need those.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_5 = ~z~Better safe than sorry.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_6 = ~z~What were you thinking?

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_7 = ~z~Well according to this...

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_8 = ~z~the loot is located in a strong box, which is in the back.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_9 = ~z~I'll put on a little performance and you can scurry round...

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_10 = ~z~open the strong box and relieve them of their goodies.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_11 = ~z~And how do I open the strong box...

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_12 = ~z~without threatening someone to open it for me?

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_13 = ~z~This should work.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_14 = ~z~And I can do this silently?

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_15 = ~z~Well I'm hoping complete silence won't be necessary...

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_16 = ~z~but you're going to wish you had your ear plugs.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_17 = ~z~Mrs. Damsen...

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_18 = ~z~Oh, very good, Alden, very good.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_19 = ~z~Course, if everything goes wrong...

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_20 = ~z~you can wave your guns round like you normally do.

RCHRB_S1_MCS1_21 = ~z~Hold tight, they'll be here soon.

RCHRB_SG2B_1 = ~z~What was that noise?

RCHRB_SG2C_1 = ~z~Who's this feller?

RCHRB_SP1B_1 = ~z~What the hell does he want?

RCHRB_SP1_1 = ~z~Who the hell is this?

RCHRB_SP2C_1 = ~z~Who are you?

RCHRB_T1_1 = ~z~There it is, right on time. Let's go.

RCHRB_T1_2 = ~z~Keep your distance so they don't see you... and, please leave that gun in its holster for once.

RCHRB_T3PA_1 = ~z~Okay, maybe this can still work, if you hang back for heaven's sake. Are you capable of that?

RCHRB_T3_1 = ~z~I'll ride ahead and get the coach to stop.

RCHRB_T3_2 = ~z~You hang back, don't let them spot you or you'll scupper the whole thing.

RCHRB_TORHDS_1 = ~z~So where do we find this friend of yours?

RCHRB_TORHDS_2 = ~z~Rhodes.

RCHRB_TORHDS_3 = ~z~Because what can possibly go wrong there?

RCHRB_TORHDS_4 = ~z~Well, lead the way and we'll find out.

RCHRB_TRE_ITEM_1 = ~z~So~rp~ I gotta ask, one last time... and be straight with me.

RCHRB_TRE_ITEM_2 = ~z~Did you tell those bounty hunters anything we need to worry about?~rp~ Whatever it is we'll work it out.

RCHRB_TRE_ITEM_3 = ~z~Really, Arthur? Please.~rp~ I like to talk, but I haven't survived this long without knowing when to keep my mouth shut.

RCHRB_TRE_ITEM_4 = ~z~Okay,~rp~ I had to ask.

RCHRB_TRE_ITEM_5 = ~z~But with the price on your heads, especially on Dutch,~rp~ there will be more where they came from.

RCHRB_TRE_ITEM_6 = ~z~Yeah... I know.

RCHRB_V_1 = ~z~You made quite a mess there, Arthur. My way would have been so much cleaner, but there we go...
