0x045E5A43 = ~z~You know what? You're a real bastard. Just leave me alone!

0x046D2EB2 = ~z~The man just died! Have some decency!

0x0B818535 = ~z~If you haven't found anything would you keep looking? We're running out of time I'm afraid...

0x5DEC96F7 = ~z~Well, I appreciate the help, anyway. More eyes, the better, right?

0x5FFA373A = ~z~And though you saw fit to kill him in such a gruesome manner... I know he only wants to be by your side.

0x7D940D68 = ~z~Saved your skin, you did.

0x45FBE348 = ~z~What did I do to you?

0x51D9C675 = ~z~Tucker! If this is a joke, it ain't funny!

0x969919EC = ~z~Oh, please don't!

0x7447948D = ~z~Listen, if you ain't gonna help, just leave me alone, okay?

0x34309658 = ~z~Thank you, friend. If only I could have done the same for Tucker...

0x72140497 = ~z~Please, open up the search. No good for us to cover the same ground.

0xBF32635D = ~z~Christ, he can't be out here this long...

0xC8C4568F = ~z~I got this area. Think you could look elsewhere, cover more ground?

0xC9CD1952 = ~z~All hat, no saddle.

0xC5600F1A = ~z~Quit talking and look if you're so curious!

0xCDC5EF5A = ~z~~sl:5.5~Oh shit, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

0xD3D4FEF6 = ~z~Hey, so... find anything?

0xD81C878B = ~z~What do you want?
