DMINO_ABI2_3 = ~z~I always liked her.

DMINO_ABI2_4 = ~z~Me too... but you know how this life is. You know it ain't easy.

DMINO_ABI2_5 = ~z~Oh I do.

DMINO_HOSEA1_1 = ~z~I'm watching you like a hawk, Matthews.

DMINO_HOSEA1_2 = ~z~What are you insinuating? I am a man of honor.

DMINO_HOSEA1_3 = ~z~You're a conman.

DMINO_HOSEA1_4 = ~z~It's pretty hard to cheat at dominoes.

DMINO_HOSEA1_5 = ~z~You can cheat at anything.

DMINO_HOSEA1_6 = ~z~That might be the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.

DMINO_HOSEA2_1 = ~z~Bessie and I would play this for hours back in the day.

DMINO_HOSEA2_2 = ~z~I remember. I think she might have even taught me to play.

DMINO_HOSEA2_3 = ~z~You know, you might be right. A lifetime ago...

DMINO_HOSEA2_4 = ~z~Sure feels like it.

DMINO_MBETH1_1 = ~z~So I been meaning to ask... what's that flower you keep by your bed?

DMINO_MBETH1_2 = ~z~Something my ma always liked. It's kind of a good luck charm, I suppose.

DMINO_MBETH1_3 = ~z~They only grow out west, in parts of California and Oregon...

DMINO_MBETH1_4 = ~z~I always try to grab one when I'm out that way.

DMINO_MBETH1_5 = ~z~That's nice.

DMINO_MBETH1_6 = ~z~I don't remember too much from back then. I was so young when she passed...

DMINO_MBETH1_7 = ~z~but I remember that for some reason.

DMINO_MBETH2_1 = ~z~How about we make this interesting? Whoever wins gets to read the other one's journal.

DMINO_MBETH2_2 = ~z~Oh no, I don't think so.

DMINO_MBETH2_3 = ~z~What have you got to hide?

DMINO_MBETH2_4 = ~z~Plenty.

DMINO_MBETH2_5 = ~z~Now I really want to read it.

DMINO_PEARSON1_1 = ~z~You know when we were at sea, we'd dab jam on the back of the dominoes to stop them sliding around.

DMINO_PEARSON1_2 = ~z~That's a strange story.

DMINO_PEARSON1_3 = ~z~It's always smelled like strawberries below deck on domino night.

DMINO_PEARSON1_4 = ~z~Was this the navy or Goldilocks and the Three Bears?

DMINO_PEARSON1_5 = ~z~We always knew how to improvise, Mr. Morgan.

DMINO_TILLY1_1 = ~z~Can't believe the dominoes survived Blackwater but my necklace didn't.

DMINO_TILLY1_2 = ~z~Oh yeah... I thought something looked different.

DMINO_TILLY1_3 = ~z~Well, I stole that one... I'm sure I can steal another easy enough.

DMINO_TILLY1_4 = ~z~I'll keep my eye out for you too.

DMINO_TILLY2_1 = ~z~If the Pinkertons could see you now.

DMINO_TILLY2_2 = ~z~Killer, bank robber, dominoes player...
