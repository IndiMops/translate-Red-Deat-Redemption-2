IND1_EXTB_14 = ~z~Yeah, I met him too, with the mayor.

IND1_EXTB_15 = ~z~He's lobbying officials in Saint Denis on their behalf.

IND1_EXTB_16 = ~z~Maybe we could help?

IND1_EXTB_17 = ~z~Maybe.

IND1_EXTB_20 = ~z~And Trelawny, he's investigating for us.

IND1_EXTB_21 = ~z~He says to meet him at the tailors.

IND1_EXTB_22 = ~z~Okay.

IND1_EXTB_23 = ~z~One big score down here, Arthur, and we disappear.

IND1_EXTB_24 = ~z~We're almost heading home.

IND1_EXTB_25 = ~z~And where is home?

IND1_EXTB_26 = ~z~I don't know...

IND1_EXTB_27 = ~z~exactly.

IND1_EXTB_28 = ~z~But I can smell it.

IND1_EXT_3 = ~z~and go home.

IND1_EXT_4 = ~z~I ain't never felt so awkward in all my life...

IND1_EXT_5 = ~z~all them folk, all so pleased with themselves.

IND1_EXT_6 = ~z~High society's pigeon shit.

IND1_EXT_7 = ~z~If you ask me...

IND1_EXT_8 = ~z~it's more like torture.

IND1_EXT_9 = ~z~Well, that's sort of the point of it isn't it...

IND1_EXT_10 = ~z~let the people torture themselves.

IND1_EXT_11 = ~z~Here's them papers I took.

IND1_EXT_12 = ~z~Anybody see you take this?

IND1_EXT_13 = ~z~I don't think so.

IND1_EXT_14 = ~z~I might have an idea...

IND1_EXT_15 = ~z~let me think on it.

IND1_FOUND_1 = ~z~Hey, you shouldn't be here.

IND1_FROMTAILOR_1 = ~z~Ah good. Look. Our chariot awaits.

IND1_GOBCK_1 = ~z~Merde, where'd I leave it... must've dropped it in the office.

IND1_IG2_CONV_6 = ~z~I used to quite often... there can be fine pickings.

IND1_IG2_CONV_7 = ~z~No, no, no, no, no pick pocketing. We're here to make real contacts.

IND1_IG2_CONV_8 = ~z~What kind of contacts?

IND1_IG2_CONV_9 = ~z~Well I don't know. We will find what we can.

IND1_IG2_CONV_10 = ~z~All I know for sure is we're going to a party at the mayor's house and the guest of honor is the worst crook in town.

IND1_IG2_CONV_11 = ~z~

IND1_IG2_CONV_12 = ~z~I am sure that we will find something.

IND1_IG2_CONV_13 = ~z~Okay.

IND1_IG2_CONV_14 = ~z~

IND1_IG2_DRIVE_1 = ~z~Drive on.

IND1_IG4_5 = ~z~Mr. Bronte is very good friends with the mayor. Good evening, Pierre.

IND1_IG4_6 = ~z~Signor Napoli.

IND1_IG4_7 = ~z~A-as long as the mayor behaves himself, you know?

IND1_IG4_8 = ~z~Mr. Bronte he has, uh, that thing, you know? Respect.

IND1_IG4_9 = ~z~Hosea, Bill, you join the party.

IND1_IG4_10 = ~z~We'll meet you out back after we pay our respects to Signor Bronte.

IND1_IG4_11 = ~z~~sl:0.3~Come, come.

IND1_IG6_B_1 = ~z~Gentlemen, enjoy your evening and welcome once again to Saint Denis.

IND1_IG6_B_2 = ~z~Ciao, ciao.

IND1_IG6_B_3 = ~z~Gentlemen... let's go ingratiate ourselves.

IND1_IG6_C_1 = ~z~Okay.

IND1_IG6_C_2 = ~z~Go find the mayor if you can, and stay outta trouble. And steal nothing...

IND1_IG6_C_3 = ~z~unless it's information.

IND1_IG6_C_4 = ~z~Of course.

IND1_IG6_C_5 = ~z~Hosea, you go find us some place to rob.

IND1_IG6_C_6 = ~z~Bill, go make us some new friends.

IND1_IG6_C_7 = ~z~I'm gonna find out if old Cornwall and what's-his-name, Milton, knows we're here.

IND1_IG6_C_8 = ~z~Gentlemen, be well.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_1 = ~z~The truth is, since the war, the country's doomed itself.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_2 = ~z~I disagree. The war? The war was thirty years ago.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_3 = ~z~I was just a boy.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_4 = ~z~And since then, we have fought more wars and we will fight more again.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_5 = ~z~The country tore itself apart.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_6 = ~z~The country? Don't even exist.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_7 = ~z~We exist.

IND1_IG7_TALK1_8 = ~z~And my family? Well, they did well out of the war.

IND1_IG7_TALK2_1 = ~z~My family lost a generation of men.

IND1_IG7_TALK2_2 = ~z~And my family made a fortune.

IND1_IG7_TALK2_3 = ~z~Fact is, war is good for business. For most business.

IND1_IG7_TALK3_1 = ~z~You have no honor, sir.

IND1_IG7_TALK3_2 = ~z~Oh, don't be like that, Mannersby.

IND1_IG7_TALK3_3 = ~z~Honor is a made up idea people use to get others to fight for them.

IND1_IG7_TALK4_1 = ~z~I do believe, sir, you are a cynic.

IND1_IG7_TALK4_2 = ~z~I hope so, Mannserby, I really do.

IND1_IG7_TALK4_3 = ~z~I think I have heard just about enough.

IND1_IG7_TALK5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.3~A-And what do you think, sir?

IND1_IG7_TALK5_2 = ~z~I think war is a fine way of... thinning the herd.

IND1_IG7_TALK5_3 = ~z~~sl:1.5~Exactly. This man is a realist.

IND1_IG7_TALK5_4 = ~z~I cannot believe I am hearing this.

IND1_IG7_TALK5_5 = ~z~Excuse me.

IND1_IG7_TALK6_1 = ~z~Sometimes, sir, the innocent are the damned.

IND1_IG7_TALK6_2 = ~z~Enjoy your evening, I must go see my wife.

IND1_IG7_TALK6_3 = ~z~Good evening.

IND1_IG8_EXIT_1 = ~z~

IND1_IG8_INTER_1 = ~z~Good evening, Mr. Hawksbill. Please stop pestering me.

IND1_IG8_INTER_2 = ~z~Madam...

IND1_IG8_LEAVE_1 = ~z~Good evening, Mr. Hawksbill. Please stop pestering me.

IND1_IG8_LEAVE_2 = ~z~Madam...

IND1_IG8_LOVE_1 = ~z~~sl:1.9~I am not the shallow cad I appear, sir. I love that woman.

IND1_IG8_LUCK_1 = ~z~Good luck with that.

IND1_IG8_PART1_1 = ~z~Of course I'm married, Miss Tweedie.

IND1_IG8_PART1_2 = ~z~But marriage is more... business, than romance.

IND1_IG8_PART1_3 = ~z~And you're a romantic, are you Mr. Hawksbill?

IND1_IG8_PART2_1 = ~z~Always have been... a true romantic. A dreamer.

IND1_IG8_PART2_2 = ~z~Why don't you let me show you someday?

IND1_IG8_PART2_3 = ~z~And you think my cousin would appreciate that demonstration?

IND1_IG8_PART3_1 = ~z~Your cousin is a cold woman. I'm a very lonely man.

IND1_IG8_PART3_2 = ~z~And I am more than someone's blanket against the night's chill.

IND1_IG9_A_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~So anyway, I heard that Judith Hawksbill~sl:~has taken a lover.

IND1_IG9_A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Of course she has,~sl:~that slippery fool has had that coming for years.

IND1_IG9_A_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~But that's not the interesting part.~sl:0.0:2.2~What's interesting is that her lover...~sl:0.2~is a Pole.

IND1_IG9_A_4 = ~z~A Pole?

IND1_IG9_A_5 = ~z~A Russian... something like that.

IND1_IG9_A_6 = ~z~Like a Jew?

IND1_IG9_A_7 = ~z~Not that bad, but nearly.

IND1_IG9_B_1 = ~z~Oh how could she make love to a European?

IND1_IG9_B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~It's disgusting.~sl:0.2~I never have.

IND1_IG9_B_3 = ~z~I know. Next thing she'll be discussing socialism.

IND1_IG9_B_4 = ~z~~sl:1.1~I can only imagine...

IND1_IG9_B_5 = ~z~~sl:0.4:2.6~Will you please excuse me Emeline,~sl:~I must just go speak with my husband a moment.

IND1_IG9_D1_1 = ~z~Excuse us, sir, we are having a private conversation.

IND1_IG9_D1_2 = ~z~Uhh, um... forgive me, ladies... I-I am new in town.

IND1_IG9_D1_3 = ~z~Excuse me, both of you, but I must just go speak with my husband a moment.

IND1_IG9_D2_1 = ~z~Her husband... he's an even worse tomcat.

IND1_IG9_D2_2 = ~z~But let's just keep that between ourselves...

IND1_IG9_D3_1 = ~z~Good evening, sir. Enjoy your stay in Saint Denis.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_1 = ~z~Well, I'm not quite sure yet... Albert Danielson.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_2 = ~z~Brynn Tildon, this is Mr. Hector Fellowes.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_3 = ~z~Well, it's uh... nice to meet the both of ya.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_4 = ~z~New suit?

IND1_IG10_CHAT_5 = ~z~Yeah... uh-I mean no, uh-uh no, it-it's a new shirt.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_6 = ~z~Are you new in town?

IND1_IG10_CHAT_7 = ~z~~sl:0.3~Yes, I come from the west, I mean the north... the uh, the-the northwest.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_8 = ~z~Okay... I came down from Washington, myself, many years ago.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_9 = ~z~This town gets to a man, undermines even the best of us.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_10 = ~z~I'm doing my best, sir.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_11 = ~z~Truth is an absolute, sir... don't you think?

IND1_IG10_CHAT_12 = ~z~Well, I don't quite understand.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_13 = ~z~You are not, it would seem, the only one.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_14 = ~z~I was in the army once.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_15 = ~z~Good for you.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_16 = ~z~What do you do now?

IND1_IG10_CHAT_17 = ~z~Well, uh, I-I'm not quite, uh... I'm an American.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_18 = ~z~Yes, but what do you do?

IND1_IG10_CHAT_19 = ~z~Oh, uh... well I'm in between jobs at the moment.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_20 = ~z~Oh, of course...of course.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_21 = ~z~You shall be too sir, if you don't sharpen up your morality.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_22 = ~z~I'm trying sir, I'm trying.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_23 = ~z~Well, try harder. Much harder.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_24 = ~z~W-what would you like me to do, hit the mayor myself?

IND1_IG10_CHAT_25 = ~z~Impudence... I see you've still got that.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_26 = ~z~But it takes more than a steady line in insults, to succeed in newspapers... at least in mine.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_27 = ~z~Good evening.

IND1_IG10_CHAT_28 = ~z~~sl:1.3~Prig.

IND1_IG10_ENTER_1 = ~z~Can I help you, sir?

IND1_IG11_CHAT_1 = ~z~This is quite a town that you have here, Mr. Jameson.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_2 = ~z~Oh, I... I don't live here, I was here for the poker.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_3 = ~z~Oh, you play?

IND1_IG11_CHAT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.7~It's my weakness, my worst vice.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1:1~Perhaps you should have it whipped out of you like you advocate whipping the sin out of others?

IND1_IG11_CHAT_6 = ~z~

IND1_IG11_CHAT_7 = ~z~

IND1_IG11_CHAT_8 = ~z~Not whipping, sir, working, and besides, my vice is between me and my maker. I keep winning.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2:1~Every gambler says that, Mr. Jameson.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_10 = ~z~Yes, I know, but like I said, the next big tournament, which I will not be attending, is for a game too rich for my blood.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_11 = ~z~I may be a knave, but I'm a sensible knave.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_12 = ~z~That so?

IND1_IG11_CHAT_13 = ~z~Well, sure, I'm not a wealthy man... I run a prison.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_14 = ~z~The old river boat tournaments are for card sharks and rich fools...

IND1_IG11_CHAT_15 = ~z~a really big stakes game attracts oilmen and such like, well, from all over.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_16 = ~z~My pockets are not deep enough for that.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_17 = ~z~~sl:0.6~You are a wise man.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_18 = ~z~~sl:0.6~I'm a conservative man, at least.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_19 = ~z~The fact is, since the war, the government has done an awful job of preserving law and order, Mr. Jameson.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_20 = ~z~~sl:0.6~Yes, well, I agree, Major.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_21 = ~z~Well, at my prison, we are doing the best to remedy that failing.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_22 = ~z~You know, my friend works in the Caribbean. He faces real rebellion.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_23 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~If we don't act decisively, we will endure the same here and all of this...~sl:~all these garden parties and civility? They will be doomed.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_24 = ~z~I believe in civilizing the masses, sir... but the first order of civilization is order. Law and order.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_25 = ~z~I agree.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_26 = ~z~Without law and order, we will have anarchy.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_27 = ~z~But with too much law and order, won't we have dictatorship, or worse... monarchy?

IND1_IG11_CHAT_28 = ~z~The law should be a dictator. That is the American way.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_29 = ~z~I thought the American ideal was liberty?

IND1_IG11_CHAT_30 = ~z~~sl:0.8~Sure... liberty under the law.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_31 = ~z~~sl:0.5~Very interesting.

IND1_IG11_CHAT_32 = ~z~~sl:1.4~Major Crawley, Mr. Chambers, I must go speak to someone for a second...

IND1_IG11_CHAT_33 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~What a vulgar toad of a man...~sl:0.2~but that riverboat sounds interesting...

IND1_IG11_ENTER_1 = ~z~Well, hello, gentlemen. Featherstone Chambers... pleased to meet you.

IND1_IG11_ENTER_2 = ~z~Heston Jameson.

IND1_IG11_ENTER_3 = ~z~What a beautiful evening.

IND1_IG11_ENTER_4 = ~z~Sure.

IND1_IG12_ARTH_1 = ~z~Could be interesting, I'll keep investigating...

IND1_IG12_ARTH_2 = ~z~What a loathsome selection of humanity.

IND1_IG12_ENT_1 = ~z~Good evening, sir... Alfred Lafonde.

IND1_IG12_ENT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0:1~Gilbert Knightly.

IND1_IG12_GRATS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3:1~And congratulations... a wife is a wonderful thing.

IND1_IG12_PART1_1 = ~z~You French, sir?

IND1_IG12_PART1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Sort of, originally... I'm from Quebec,~sl:~but I left many moons ago, and you?

IND1_IG12_PART1_3 = ~z~~sl:1.3:0.0~No, I came down from New York, for a job. I'm a banker.

IND1_IG12_PART1_4 = ~z~A banker?

IND1_IG12_PART1_5 = ~z~An investment banker.

IND1_IG12_PART1_6 = ~z~You're the fellows who never lend me money when I need it,

IND1_IG12_PART1_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1:1~and when I've got too much, try to lend me more.

IND1_IG12_PART1_8 = ~z~~sl:2.0:0.0~And what do you do, Mr. Lafonde?

IND1_IG12_PART1_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.3~Originally furs... but, now all sorts.~sl:0.1~Lumber, leather, even maple syrup...

IND1_IG12_PART1_10 = ~z~My partners and I represent twenty, well more like twenty-three percent

IND1_IG12_PART1_11 = ~z~of all the trade heading south from Quebec into the U.S.

IND1_IG12_PART1_12 = ~z~And... who do you bank with?

IND1_IG12_PART1_13 = ~z~Oh... the usual bunch of clowns in New York.

IND1_IG12_PART1_14 = ~z~Do you bank with anyone in the South?

IND1_IG12_PART1_15 = ~z~Not one I particularly like.

IND1_IG12_PART2_1 = ~z~Well, have you considered Lemoyne National Bank?

IND1_IG12_PART2_2 = ~z~Oh, I need a big bank, sir.

IND1_IG12_PART2_3 = ~z~We borrow a lot of money, and generate a lot of cash.

IND1_IG12_PART2_4 = ~z~Some nervous, small town bank could finish us in a bad year...

IND1_IG12_PART2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4:1~Small town?

IND1_IG12_PART2_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~We handle more cash and cash equivalents~sl:~than any bank south of Manhattan, including Saint Louis.

IND1_IG12_PART2_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Almost all the Caribbean trade banks with us.~sl:0.3~We work with all the remaining cotton growers in the U.S.,

IND1_IG12_PART2_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~who still use a lot of cash, and...~sl:~we helped finance half the reconstruction projects after the war.

IND1_IG12_PART2_9 = ~z~We love big clients... and we love cash.

IND1_IG12_PART2_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~Our branch alone, here in town, has more cash reserves on site~sl:~than any bank in the entire country...

IND1_IG12_PART2_11 = ~z~outside of Wall Street and San Francisco.

IND1_IG26_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~There's plenty of money moves through here, of course, and I...~sl:~I think I found out how we can grab some of it.

IND1_IG26_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5:1~A big bank... a real one, I mean, but not yet.

IND1_IG26_5 = ~z~A city bank?

IND1_IG26_6 = ~z~Maybe... and a stuffed one.

IND1_IG26_7 = ~z~If we're gonna leave, that could be the one thing we need.

IND1_IG26_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~There's also that trolley car station Signor Bronte told us about,~sl:~and I heard about a high stakes poker game...

IND1_IG27_MAIN_11 = ~z~Undeniable, demonstrable... I will not deny it simply because of fashion.

IND1_IG27_MAIN_12 = ~z~I'm intrigued, sir, to hear your arguments...

IND1_IG27_MAIN_13 = ~z~I am your clear superior.

IND1_IG31_MAIN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~These dancers... well, I mean, if that's French culture for you,~sl:~sign me up for French lessons!

IND1_IG_GOSS1_1 = ~z~You know I swear half the men in here are dipping their quill in another ink well.

IND1_IG_GOSS1_4 = ~z~Well... gives us something to talk about...

IND1_IG_GOSS2_1 = ~z~If you heard what I said about Europeans, I hope it didn't offend you.

IND1_IG_GOSS2_2 = ~z~It's mainly their politics I can't stand.

IND1_IG_GOSS2_3 = ~z~Not at all. I worked with an Irishman... and he was a terrible person.

IND1_IG_GOSS2_4 = ~z~It takes all my gumption to sleep with Frederic here and he's as capitalist as they come.

IND1_MCS3_69 = ~z~It'll make you long for the days...

IND1_MCS3_70 = ~z~when you could shoot each other...

IND1_MCS3_71 = ~z~and screw cows out on the open range.

IND1_MCS3_72 = ~z~Those sure were the days...

IND1_MCS3_73 = ~z~Good day, gentlemen.

IND1_MCS3_74 = ~z~Good day to you.

IND1_MCS3_75 = ~z~But before you go...

IND1_MCS3_76 = ~z~what exactly are your plans here?

IND1_MCS3_77 = ~z~We've not made any...

IND1_MCS3_78 = ~z~well...

IND1_MCS3_79 = ~z~we are going to need some money.

IND1_MCS3_80 = ~z~Money...

IND1_MCS3_81 = ~z~yes, of course.

IND1_MCS3_82 = ~z~Well, there's, there's money at the trolley station.

IND1_MCS3_83 = ~z~They keep a lot of cash there in the day.

IND1_MCS3_84 = ~z~Now I could not involve myself in such matters...

IND1_MCS3_85 = ~z~but you...

IND1_MCS3_86 = ~z~as a guest, yes.

IND1_MCS3_87 = ~z~As my guest, do it.

IND1_MCS3_88 = ~z~Okay, good day, gentlemen.

IND1_MCS3_89 = ~z~Goodbye.

IND1_MCS3_90 = ~t~In Italian: Okay guys, now the good wine.

IND1_MCS3_LI_1 = ~z~

IND1_MCS3_LI_2 = ~z~Ahh, the angry cowboys, you've arrived...

IND1_MCS3_LI_3 = ~z~and you've washed.

IND1_MCS3_LI_4 = ~t~In Italian: For the first time this month no doubt.

IND1_MCS3_LI_5 = ~z~This is quite a party you've invited us to.

IND1_MCS3_LI_6 = ~z~Yes, quite something...

IND1_MCS4_1 = ~z~You're drunk, Ferdinand.

IND1_MCS4_2 = ~z~I'm not drunk, you fool...

IND1_MCS4_3 = ~z~but this man...

IND1_MCS4_4 = ~z~this man loves darkies.

IND1_MCS4_5 = ~z~You are pretty drunk.

IND1_MCS4_LI2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~It ain't complex, Lemieux...~sl:~and only an idiot like you, buddy, would try to make it so.

IND1_MCS4_LI2_2 = ~z~I will not deny idiocy, sir, but perhaps now is not the time.

IND1_MCS4_LI2_3 = ~z~~sl:1.5~Typical pansy.

IND1_MCS4_LI_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Gentlemen, I hope you are having a fine evening.

IND1_MCS4_LI_2 = ~z~Ah, Mr. Mayor, wonderful to see you again.

IND1_MCS4_LI_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Lemieux, this intellectual here was just insulting me~sl:~regarding the red skins.

IND1_MCS4_LI_4 = ~z~I did no such thing...

IND1_MCS4_LI_5 = ~z~

IND1_MCS4_LI_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~but Mr. Lemieux,~sl:0.2:2.9~I suggested that all of us, as Americans,~sl:~had a duty to take care of people living in this land...

IND1_MCS4_LI_7 = ~z~and that extends to Saint Denis.

IND1_MCS4_LI_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~But, Mr. Miller,~sl:0.2:3.0~the Indian problem is not an urban problem~sl:~but a rural problem.

IND1_MCS4_LI_9 = ~z~And here in Saint Denis, we have problems of our own.

IND1_MCS4_LI_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~I beg to differ sir.~sl:0.5:2.1~It is not a rural problem,~sl:0.0:2.4~but a human problem.~sl:~An American problem.

IND1_MCS4_LI_11 = ~z~We want to end this century yet more besmirched,

IND1_MCS4_LI_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~blood and guilt because of more sins?~sl:0.4~Do we wish to better ourselves?

IND1_MCS4_LI_13 = ~z~I'd hope the latter.

IND1_MCS4_LI_14 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~As of course do I,~sl:0.0:3.3~but things are more complex in the matters of men~sl:~than in the heads of the intellectuals.

IND1_MCS4_LI_A_1 = ~z~

IND1_MCS4_LI_A_2 = ~z~You're gonna thank me tomorrow.

IND1_MCS4_LI_A_3 = ~z~Get off...

IND1_MCS4_LI_A_4 = ~z~You got two choices, Mister.

IND1_MCS4_LI_A_5 = ~z~You sit down and calm down, or I can rip your arm right off your shoulder, which is it?

IND1_MCS4_LI_A_6 = ~z~Don't you...

IND1_MCS4_LI_B_1 = ~z~Sit down and calm down... count to a thousand.

IND1_MCS4_LI_B_2 = ~z~Then you can rejoin the party.

IND1_MCS4_LO_1 = ~z~What's say you and me cool off?

IND1_MCS4_LO_2 = ~z~

IND1_MCS5_1 = ~z~Thank you, sir.

IND1_MCS5_2 = ~z~My pleasure.

IND1_MCS5_3 = ~z~Henri Lemieux...

IND1_MCS5_4 = ~z~I hope you're enjoying my party.

IND1_MCS5_5 = ~z~The mayor?

IND1_MCS5_6 = ~z~Allegedly.

IND1_MCS5_7 = ~z~That's quite a place you got here.

IND1_MCS5_8 = ~z~It's not mine...

IND1_MCS5_9 = ~z~and the city is horribly in debt...

IND1_MCS5_10 = ~z~but we can still put on a good show.

IND1_MCS5_11 = ~z~Do you know Evelyn Miller?

IND1_MCS5_12 = ~z~My Lord...

IND1_MCS5_13 = ~z~the writer?

IND1_MCS5_14 = ~z~Well, we seem to have another deranged drunkard on our hands.

IND1_MCS5_15 = ~z~Shall we?

IND1_MCS5_16 = ~z~My Lord, they're fantastic.

IND1_MCS5_17 = ~z~Excuse me, pardon...

IND1_MCS5_18 = ~z~excuse me, pardon...

IND1_MCS5_19 = ~z~Messieurs, please...

IND1_MCS5_20 = ~z~Mr. Cornwall was quite insistent, I'm afraid...

IND1_MCS5_21 = ~z~he shouted down the telephone for several minutes.

IND1_MCS5_22 = ~z~Mr. Cornwall is a horse's ass...

IND1_MCS5_23 = ~z~and a bad horse.

IND1_MCS5_24 = ~z~I'm very sorry, sir.

IND1_MCS5_25 = ~z~It's not your fault...

IND1_MCS5_26 = ~z~I'm a fool for trusting him.

IND1_MCS5_27 = ~z~I'll come and sign it in a minute...

IND1_MCS5_28 = ~z~let me enjoy the fireworks.

IND1_MCS5_29 = ~z~Of course.

IND1_MCS5_30 = ~z~Did he just say something about Cornwall?

IND1_MCS5_31 = ~z~Yes.

IND1_MCS5_32 = ~z~Find out what.

IND1_MCS5_33 = ~z~Sure.

IND1_MCS5_LI_1 = ~z~Thank you, sir.

IND1_MCS5_LI_2 = ~z~My pleasure.

IND1_MCS5_LI_3 = ~z~Henri Lemieux...

IND1_MCS5_LI_4 = ~z~I hope you're enjoying my party.

IND1_MCS6_1 = ~z~Find anything?

IND1_MCS6_2 = ~z~I think so.

IND1_MCS6_3 = ~z~Nothing...

IND1_MCS6_4 = ~z~this town is a waste of time.

IND1_MCS6_5 = ~z~Maybe not...

IND1_MCS6_6 = ~z~Arthur.

IND1_MCS6_LI_1 = ~z~

IND1_MCS_1_1 = ~z~Thank you good sir.

IND1_MCS_1_2 = ~z~Well, well, well, well, well...

IND1_MCS_1_3 = ~z~ain't we just the finest Yankee carpet baggers...

IND1_MCS_1_4 = ~z~ever set foot in this sophisticated metropolis?

IND1_MCS_1_5 = ~z~If you say so.

IND1_MCS_1_6 = ~z~Come on...

IND1_MCS_1_7 = ~z~let's go find out what Saint Denis thinks of itself.

IND1_MD_FND_1 = ~z~I won't ask again... Security! Security!

IND1_MD_SPT_01 = ~z~Oh, you can't be in here, sir. Please return to the party.

IND1_MD_SPT_02 = ~z~Sir, please leave or I will have to call security.

IND1_MRHAWKFW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.8:1.0:1~Look at that.

IND1_MSC3_LIC_1 = ~z~

IND1_MSC3_LIC_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Who's, eh... who's going to, eh...~sl:0.3~andiamo, who's going to go to the...

IND1_OFR_DRK_01 = ~z~Can I interest you in a glass of champagne?

IND1_OFR_DRK_02 = ~z~Glass of champagne, sir?

IND1_OFR_DRK_03 = ~z~Champagne, sir?

IND1_OTRSM_1 = ~z~Sorry, I've managed to get myself turned around somehow. Don't mind me.

IND1_OTRSM_2 = ~z~Not a problem, sir, please enjoy the rest of the evening.

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_1 = ~z~Self-righteous know it all...

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_2 = ~z~Excuse me?

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_3 = ~z~Oh... not you, Hector Fellowes. I thought you overheard our conversation.

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_4 = ~z~He pays me to be the editor of that newspaper, but he pokes his nose in at every turn.

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_5 = ~z~He thinks morality is unbiased, but it is quite the opposite!

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_6 = ~z~~sl:1.4~I'm sorry... I'm... ranting...

IND1_PTY_BRYNN_7 = ~z~I know.

IND1_PTY_CAM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.5~Still admiring my hat, I see.

IND1_PTY_CAM_2 = ~z~No, uh... not really.

IND1_PTY_CAM_3 = ~z~A man can appreciate fine ladies' millinery. There's no shame in it.

IND1_PTY_CAM_4 = ~z~Sure... I guess.

IND1_PTY_CAM_5 = ~z~Well, enjoy the rest of your evening.

IND1_PTY_CAM_6 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CAM_R1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.7:1.4:1~Beautiful.

IND1_PTY_CAM_R2_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CAM_R2_3 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CAM_R2_4 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CAM_R2_5 = ~z~Oh, my goodness.

IND1_PTY_CAM_R2_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6:1~Oh, will you look at that.

IND1_PTY_CAM_R3_1 = ~z~~sl:3.3~Oh my! Oh... look at that.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_1_1 = ~z~Ah! Oh my.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_2_1 = ~z~~sl:2.4~Bravo, it's just marvellous.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_3_1 = ~z~~sl:7.0:1.4:1~Oh my.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_1 = ~z~Thank you again for the champagne.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_2 = ~z~You're welcome.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_3 = ~z~So... how do you know the mayor?

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_4 = ~z~Oh, I don't really. It's just another party and I get invited to parties.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_5 = ~z~Ah, I see.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_6 = ~z~All very boring really. Hence the need for copious amounts of champagne.

IND1_PTY_CL_A_T_7 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CL_B_1_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CL_B_2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.8:2.1:1~Oh...

IND1_PTY_CL_B_3_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CL_B_4_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_1 = ~z~Thank you for the champagne, I'm glad there's still some gentlemen left around here.

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_2 = ~z~Well, I hate to see a lady with an empty glass.

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_3 = ~z~Not like that horrible man on the balcony, Mr. Bronte.

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_4 = ~z~Oh, yes?

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_5 = ~z~Why he gets the pride of place is beyond me.

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_6 = ~z~Well, I've heard he's a very generous benefactor to the city.

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_7 = ~z~~sl:0.4~Dirty money. Anyway... don't get me started!

IND1_PTY_CL_B_T_8 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CL_CG1_1 = ~z~Good evening. A question for you, sir.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG1_2 = ~z~Are you familiar with the work of Charles Chatenay?

IND1_PTY_CL_CG1_3 = ~z~No, sorry, can't say I am.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.3:1~Oh well, not to worry. I do encourage you to view some of his pieces.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG1_5 = ~z~Very provocative... I'll leave you to your evening.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_1 = ~z~Oh, my knight with the shining champagne bottle.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_2 = ~z~A question for you, sir. Are you an appreciator of art, by any chance?

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_3 = ~z~Uh... yeah, I guess you could say that?

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_4 = ~z~Maybe you can help resolve a debate my friends and I were having.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_5 = ~z~Are you familiar with the work of Charles Chatenay?

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_6 = ~z~Oh yes... all too well.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_7 = ~z~~sl:0.9:0.0~How do you like him?

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.7~He's uh... I describe him as...~sl:0.7~complex and... passionate?

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_9 = ~z~Exactly! That is how I feel! Thank you, sir, debate closed.

IND1_PTY_CL_CG2_10 = ~z~I'll leave you to enjoy your evening.

IND1_PTY_CMP_1 = ~z~Are you enjoying the party?

IND1_PTY_CMP_2 = ~z~How do you know the mayor?

IND1_PTY_CMP_3 = ~z~I don't, uh, I'm actually hoping to meet him.

IND1_PTY_CMP_4 = ~z~He's definitely around, I just saw him. A man in demand.

IND1_PTY_CMP_5 = ~z~I'm sure.

IND1_PTY_CMP_R1_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CMP_R1_2 = ~z~Oh!

IND1_PTY_CMP_R1_3 = ~z~Oh...

IND1_PTY_CMP_R1_4 = ~z~Oh, this is my favorite.

IND1_PTY_CMP_R1_5 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CMP_R2_1 = ~z~Wow!

IND1_PTY_CRW_1 = ~z~Did you hear him back there, "the law should be a dictator"?

IND1_PTY_CRW_2 = ~z~I wasn't really listening.

IND1_PTY_CRW_3 = ~z~Lucky for you, and as for that other feller... Featherstone Chambers? What a windbag he is.

IND1_PTY_CRW_4 = ~z~He did seem full of himself.

IND1_PTY_CRW_5 = ~z~~sl:0.9~Anyway...

IND1_PTY_CRW_R2_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_CRW_R3_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_FELLOW_1 = ~z~So hard these days, to find men of true morals.

IND1_PTY_FELLOW_2 = ~z~Especially in journalism!

IND1_PTY_FELLOW_3 = ~z~Indeed, it is.

IND1_PTY_FELLOW_4 = ~z~And you certainly won't find many here... how do you think they got so rich?

IND1_PTY_FELLOW_5 = ~z~Well, anyway... enjoy your evening.

IND1_PTY_GILB_1 = ~z~I think I saw you earlier.

IND1_PTY_GILB_2 = ~z~Yes, you were talking to that blowhard, Alfred Lafonde.

IND1_PTY_GILB_3 = ~z~Ah, you know him...

IND1_PTY_GILB_4 = ~z~Are his... money interests as large as he made out?

IND1_PTY_GILB_5 = ~z~Oh, very much so.

IND1_PTY_JAM_A_1 = ~z~Oh, the eavesdropper...

IND1_PTY_JAM_A_2 = ~z~I had to get away from that awful Major Crawley, pontificating on law and order.

IND1_PTY_JAM_A_3 = ~z~You should see my prison, that's what law and order looks like.

IND1_PTY_JAM_A_4 = ~z~Hopefully as a visitor and not as an inmate.

IND1_PTY_JAM_A_5 = ~z~~sl:0.9~Indeed! Well, enjoy the rest of your evening, sir.

IND1_PTY_JAM_R1_1 = ~z~

IND1_PTY_RUP_G1_3 = ~z~He's fine, isn't he?

IND1_PTY_RUP_G1_4 = ~z~Well, yes, thanks to me!

IND1_PTY_RUP_G1_5 = ~z~Well maybe the mayor will give you a medal.

IND1_PTY_RUP_G1_6 = ~z~~sl:0.9:0.0~There's no need to be so facetious.

IND1_PTY_RUP_G2_1 = ~z~Well done, sir, saving that man! I was about to step in, myself.

IND1_PTY_RUP_G2_2 = ~z~Is that right?

IND1_PTY_RUP_G2_3 = ~z~You should freshen your glass, you deserve it!

IND1_PTY_TH1_G1_2 = ~z~I'm trying.

IND1_PTY_TH1_G1_3 = ~z~I'm bored outta my mind.

IND1_PTY_TH1_G1_4 = ~z~When are the fireworks going to start?

IND1_PTY_TH1_G1_5 = ~z~I've no idea.

IND1_PTY_TH1_G1_6 = ~z~~sl:1.0:0.0~Alright, well... try to enjoy yourself.

IND1_PTY_TH1_G2_1 = ~z~I hope you enjoy that show.

IND1_PTY_TH1_G2_2 = ~z~Sounds a little bawdy and lowbrow for my tastes.

IND1_PTY_TH1_G2_3 = ~z~But not for mine?

IND1_PTY_TH1_G2_4 = ~z~Oh I'm sure it's lots of fun. Who am I to judge?

IND1_PTY_TH1_G2_5 = ~z~Exactly.

IND1_PTY_TH2_G1_2 = ~z~Sure, why'd you give 'em to me?

IND1_PTY_TH2_G1_3 = ~z~Oh, I'm more of an opera man myself. Figured someone else should enjoy them.

IND1_PTY_TH2_G1_4 = ~z~Appreciate it.

IND1_PTY_TH2_G1_5 = ~z~I'd grab a drink if I was you, the fireworks should be starting soon.

IND1_PTY_TH2_G2_1 = ~z~Do I know you?

IND1_PTY_TH2_G2_2 = ~z~Uh, I don't think so. Tacitus Kilgore.
