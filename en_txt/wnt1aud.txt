WNT1_INT_CABIN_48 = ~z~Come on, Arthur.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_49 = ~z~Alright, we've got some work to do.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_50 = ~z~Well, we ain't run into them yet.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_51 = ~z~So...

WNT1_INT_CABIN_52 = ~z~they both must have headed down the hill.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_53 = ~z~Sure.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_54 = ~z~Hey...

WNT1_INT_CABIN_55 = ~z~I ain't had time to ask.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_56 = ~z~What really went down back there on that boat?

WNT1_INT_CABIN_57 = ~z~We missed you, that's what happened.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_58 = ~z~Come on.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_59 = ~z~Hey!

WNT1_INT_CABIN_60 = ~z~You need horses?

WNT1_INT_CABIN_61 = ~z~Oh yeah...

WNT1_INT_CABIN_62 = ~z~and Mr. Smith, get yourself indoors.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_63 = ~z~You need to rest that hand.

WNT1_INT_CABIN_64 = ~z~I'll live.

WNT1_INT_LO_1 = ~z~Get indoors, son!

WNT1_INT_LO_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7:1~I...

WNT1_INT_LO_5 = ~z~

WNT1_INT_WAGON_1 = ~z~Abigail says he's dying, Dutch.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_2 = ~z~We'll have to stop some place.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_3 = ~z~Okay. Arthur's out looking, I sent him up ahead.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_4 = ~z~If we don't stop soon, we'll all be dying.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_5 = ~z~This weather, it's May...

WNT1_INT_WAGON_6 = ~z~I'm just hoping the law got as lost as we did.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_7 = ~z~There.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_8 = ~z~Arthur! Any luck?

WNT1_INT_WAGON_9 = ~z~I found a place where we can get some shelter.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_10 = ~z~Let Davey rest while he...

WNT1_INT_WAGON_11 = ~z~you know.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_12 = ~z~An old mining town, abandoned, it ain't far.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_13 = ~z~Come on.

WNT1_INT_WAGON_14 = ~z~Come on!

WNT1_KEEP_1 = ~z~Micah, Arthur, keep looking for stuff.

WNT1_KEEP_2 = ~z~Arthur, go see if there's anything in that barn.

WNT1_KEEP_3 = ~z~Micah, you search the cabin, see what we missed.

WNT1_KEEP_4 = ~z~Sure.

WNT1_KILL_1 = ~z~Is that bastard still in there?

WNT1_KILL_2 = ~z~He's dealt with.

WNT1_LOOT1_1 = ~z~Big old pool of blood on the floor here.

WNT1_LOOT1_2 = ~z~I saw.

WNT1_LOOT1_3 = ~z~Probably the poor bastard who lived here. Micah found a dead body in the wagon outside.

WNT1_LOOT2_1 = ~z~O'Driscolls! I don't believe it.

WNT1_LOOT2_2 = ~z~It's a strange one alright. ~rp~Maybe they're hiding up here too.

WNT1_LOOT2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7:1~There's a big price on Colm O'Driscoll's head...~rp~~sl:0.2~...nearly as big as the one on yours.

WNT1_LOOT2_4 = ~z~Wanting Colm dead is about the only thing me and Uncle Sam agree on.

WNT1_LOOT3_1 = ~z~Place is dry, and warm, we could maybe move the women and Jack down here.

WNT1_LOOT3_2 = ~z~Maybe. We'll see how they are when we get back. I don't really want us to split up.

WNT1_MCS1_1 = ~z~Micah.

WNT1_MCS1_2 = ~z~Gentlemen.

WNT1_MCS1_3 = ~z~Found anything?

WNT1_MCS1_4 = ~z~I think so.

WNT1_MCS2_1 = ~z~Get away from me!

WNT1_MCS2_2 = ~z~Micah, what the hell do you think you're doing?

WNT1_MCS2_3 = ~z~Look what I found in the cellar.

WNT1_MCS2_4 = ~z~Wild thing ain't you?

WNT1_MCS2_5 = ~z~Leave her alone!

WNT1_MCS2_6 = ~z~I wasn't doing nothing.

WNT1_MCS2_7 = ~z~She's one of them O'Driscolls.

WNT1_MCS2_8 = ~z~No she ain't, Micah. Look at her.

WNT1_MCS2_9 = ~z~Miss, miss, are you...

WNT1_MCS2_10 = ~z~Oh, you fool, Micah.

WNT1_MCS2_11 = ~z~Miss, now it is gonna be okay.

WNT1_MCS2_12 = ~z~We mean you no harm.

WNT1_MCS2_13 = ~z~Miss! Miss...

WNT1_MCS2_23 = ~z~Arthur.

WNT1_MCS2_24 = ~z~Miss, it's okay, alright?

WNT1_MCS2_25 = ~z~We're bad men, but...

WNT1_MCS2_26 = ~z~we ain't them, so...

WNT1_MCS2_27 = ~z~it's okay.

WNT1_MCS2_28 = ~z~Get on.

WNT1_MCS2_29 = ~z~We'll keep you safe until you figure out...

WNT1_MCS2_30 = ~z~what you wanna do.

WNT1_MESS_01 = ~z~Arthur, what are you doing? I said get out of sight.

WNT1_MESS_02 = ~z~Arthur, take cover in that shed over there.

WNT1_MESS_03 = ~z~Arthur, get in position. Come on.
