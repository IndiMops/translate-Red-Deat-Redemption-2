WAR1_S3_IG2_ART_1 = ~z~

WAR1_S3_IG2_JHN_1 = ~z~

WAR1_S3_IG5_A_1 = ~z~Almost a shame we killed it.

WAR1_S3_IG5_B_1 = ~z~If he could speak, the stories he'd tell.

WAR1_S3_INT_13 = ~z~Sure.

WAR1_S3_INT_14 = ~z~So what do you do?

WAR1_S3_INT_15 = ~z~Me...

WAR1_S3_INT_16 = ~z~I'm a wanderer.

WAR1_S3_INT_17 = ~z~I was born further north, but I spent a lot of time out west.

WAR1_S3_INT_18 = ~z~Funny, I never saw myself as a wandering man...

WAR1_S3_INT_19 = ~z~The bodies lay so thick...

WAR1_S3_INT_20 = ~z~you coulda walked across the whole field...

WAR1_S3_INT_21 = ~z~without your boots touching mud.

WAR1_S3_INT_22 = ~z~Those were bad times.

WAR1_S3_INT_23 = ~z~Yes they were.

WAR1_S3_INT_24 = ~z~Would you like some more coffee?

WAR1_S3_INT_25 = ~z~Please.

WAR1_S3_INT_26 = ~z~What have we here?

WAR1_S3_INT_27 = ~z~Yeah, she's right across there.

WAR1_S3_INT_28 = ~z~That close?

WAR1_S3_INT_37 = ~z~Me...

WAR1_S3_INT_38 = ~z~I'm a wanderer.

WAR1_S3_INT_39 = ~z~I was born further north, spent a lot of time out west.

WAR1_S3_INT_40 = ~z~Funny, I never saw myself as a wandering man, but...

WAR1_S3_INT_41 = ~z~And who might you be?

WAR1_S3_INT_42 = ~z~A caller, John Marston.

WAR1_S3_INT_43 = ~z~Years ago a friend of mine helped you retrieve your horse...

WAR1_S3_INT_44 = ~z~and your leg.

WAR1_S3_INT_45 = ~z~Oh yeah, yeah.

WAR1_S3_INT_46 = ~z~Come on in.

WAR1_S3_INT_47 = ~z~Arthur wasn't it?

WAR1_S3_INT_48 = ~z~That's the one. He...

WAR1_S3_INT_49 = ~z~passed, soon after that.

WAR1_S3_INT_50 = ~z~I'm sorry to hear that.

WAR1_S3_INT_51 = ~z~I was reading through his journal.

WAR1_S3_INT_55 = ~z~He was a kind man to me.

WAR1_S3_INT_56 = ~z~You wanna go out hunting?

WAR1_S3_INT_57 = ~z~There's a huge she wolf that's been stalking me...

WAR1_S3_INT_58 = ~z~a few nights I've been out.

WAR1_S3_INT_59 = ~z~Sure. Why not.

WAR1_S3_INT_60 = ~z~First, let's just talk a while. Okay?

WAR1_S3_INT_61 = ~z~Okay.

WAR1_S3_INT_62 = ~z~What do you do?

WAR1_S3_INT_63 = ~z~Me...

WAR1_S3_INT_64 = ~z~I'm a wanderer.

WAR1_S3_INT_65 = ~z~I was born further north, spent a lot of time out west.

WAR1_S3_MCS1_1 = ~z~Woah.

WAR1_S3_MCS1_2 = ~z~You alright?

WAR1_S3_MCS1_3 = ~z~I was ready to offer my complete and unconditional...

WAR1_S3_MCS1_4 = ~z~I don't think the wolves woulda shown much mercy.

WAR1_S3_MCS1_5 = ~z~That's quite an ambush she led us into.

WAR1_S3_MCS1_6 = ~z~A bushwhacking, I'd call it.

WAR1_S4_INT_50 = ~z~I know you ain't forgot about him.

WAR1_S4_INT_51 = ~z~I still see him in my dreams.

WAR1_S4_INT_52 = ~z~Arthur caught that.

WAR1_S4_INT_53 = ~z~Did he?

WAR1_S4_INT_54 = ~z~And he killed that with his hands.

WAR1_S4_INT_55 = ~z~That's quite something.

WAR1_S4_INT_56 = ~z~Yeah I got the whole of nature up here...

WAR1_S4_INT_57 = ~z~and I'm gonna make the most of it...

WAR1_S4_INT_60 = ~z~What's that?

WAR1_S4_INT_61 = ~z~Right there by the outhouse.

WAR1_S4_INT_62 = ~z~Look at the size of that boar.

WAR1_S4_INT_63 = ~z~Holy hell.

WAR1_S4_INT_64 = ~z~I saw some cattle gored the other day...

WAR1_S4_INT_65 = ~z~but I didnt think it was possible.

WAR1_S4_INT_66 = ~z~Let's go take care of it.

WAR1_S4_INT_67 = ~z~Okay.

WAR1_S4_INT_68 = ~z~Damn, I thought I got him.

WAR1_S4_MCS1_7 = ~z~but he's strong.

WAR1_S4_MCS1_8 = ~z~Hamish?

WAR1_S4_MCS1_9 = ~z~Good pig...

WAR1_S4_MCS1_10 = ~z~Hamish...

WAR1_S4_MCS1_11 = ~z~Hamish?

WAR1_S4_MCS1_12 = ~z~Good pig...

WAR1_SPT_BUELL_1 = ~z~There he is.

WAR1_WALKOFF1_1 = ~z~Oh, I guess you're busy then.

WAR1_WALKOFF2_1 = ~z~So long, then.

WAR2_KNOCK_1 = ~z~The door's open.

WAR2_T_CAST2_1 = ~z~Okay. Right here. Our hopes of catching this bastard lie with you.

WAR2_T_CAST2_2 = ~z~Cast back to where we were.

WAR2_T_CAST2_3 = ~z~And make sure to use that lure I gave you.

WAR2_T_CAST_1 = ~z~Right here. We'll cast off towards the island.

WAR2_T_CTLOSE_03 = ~z~Nope. Lost him. We're gonna get this son of a bitch.

WAR2_T_CTPROG_01 = ~z~You're doing good.

WAR2_T_CTPROG_02 = ~z~There you go.

WAR2_T_CTPROG_03 = ~z~Try pulling that rod up as you reel.

WAR2_T_CTPROG_04 = ~z~We got you now, Tyrant. We got you now.

WAR2_T_CTPROG_05 = ~z~He's tiring alright.

WAR2_T_CTREELS2_01 = ~z~Stop a second.

WAR2_T_CTREELS2_02 = ~z~Let him tire.

WAR2_T_CTREELS2_03 = ~z~Give him a break.

WAR2_T_CTREELS_01 = ~z~Leave it a moment. He's fighting ya.

WAR2_T_CTREELS_02 = ~z~Wait. Don't reel while he's thrashing like that.

WAR2_T_CTREELS_03 = ~z~Stop a second. You'll snap the line you reel when he's fighting like that.

WAR2_T_CTREEL_01 = ~z~Reel it in.

WAR2_T_CTREEL_02 = ~z~Bring it in now.

WAR2_T_CTREEL_03 = ~z~Start reeling.

WAR2_T_CTREEL_04 = ~z~Time to reel.

WAR2_T_FISH0_1 = ~z~Take us over there to the right. We'll set up ten yards or so off shore.

WAR2_T_FISH1_1 = ~z~He don't keep far away from me, the Tyrant. Wants me to know who's lake it is.

WAR2_T_FISH1_3 = ~z~The optimism of youth.

WAR2_T_FISH2ND0_1 = ~z~We'll come at him from the other way. Row over there.

WAR2_T_FISH2ND1_1 = ~z~When he bumped me, I had to check twice... thought I'd find a chunk of me missing.

WAR2_T_FISH2ND1_2 = ~z~Man eating pike, that would be a first.

WAR2_T_FISH2ND1_3 = ~z~I'm not so sure...

WAR2_T_HELP0_01 = ~z~

WAR2_T_JFISH1_3 = ~z~The optimism of youth.

WAR2_T_JFISH2D1_1 = ~z~When he bumped me, I had to check twice... thought I'd find a chunk of me missing.

WAR2_T_JFISH2D1_2 = ~z~Man eating pike, that would be a first.

WAR2_T_JFISH2D1_3 = ~z~I'm not so sure...

WAR2_T_LFTBOAT_01 = ~z~Where you going? Won't catch him with your hands.

WAR2_T_LFTBOAT_02 = ~z~I'd be careful in there... the Tyrant might have you.

WAR2_T_LFTBOAT_03 = ~z~Can't say I ever thought this was much of a swimming spot.

WAR2_T_LURE_01 = ~z~He won't go for nothing, except that special lake lure... believe me, I've tried it all.

WAR2_T_LURE_02 = ~z~Other baits might work for other fish, but there's only one lure for the Tyrant.

WAR2_T_LURE_03 = ~z~I know I'm a boring old man, but I know my fishing. You want to use the lure that I gave you.

WAR2_T_LURE_04 = ~z~You're wasting your time with the wrong lure there.

WAR2_T_LURE_05 = ~z~Get in your satchel and change your lure. You won't catch the Tyrant with that.

WAR2_T_LURE_06 = ~z~No reason to be pig headed about this. Change your lure and you might catch him.

WAR2_T_NOMOVE_04 = ~z~This is peaceful and all, but we should row.

WAR2_T_REELFAST_01 = ~z~Not too quick... you want to bring it in slow.

WAR2_T_REELFAST_02 = ~z~Nice and slow, give him a chance to catch it.

WAR2_T_REELFAST_03 = ~z~Slow, okay? Needs to look like it's swimming there.

WAR2_T_REELFAST_04 = ~z~Nice and slow, okay?

WAR2_T_REELSLOW_01 = ~z~You could speed that up a little.

WAR2_T_REELSLOW_02 = ~z~Just a little faster.

WAR2_T_REELSLOW_03 = ~z~Now reel a mite quicker.

WAR2_T_REELSLOW_04 = ~z~Just a bit faster now.

WAR2_T_WRNGWAY_01 = ~z~He won't be over this way.

WAR2_T_WRNGWAY_02 = ~z~We want to find the Tyrant, we got to go over there.

WAR2_T_WRNGWAY_03 = ~z~We fishing or rowing? 'Cause the best fishing spot's over there.

WAR2_T_WRNGWAY_04 = ~z~Hey, I ain't in no hurry, you just want to go for a row, that's alright with me.

WAR3_CARCASS_1 = ~z~What we got here... that a fresh kill?

WAR3_CARCASS_2 = ~z~Could be... is the blood set?

WAR3_CARCASS_3 = ~z~Let me take a look.

WAR3_CHAT1_A_1 = ~z~We don't get her, what's the worst that can happen?

WAR3_CHAT1_A_2 = ~z~She runs off with a chicken?

WAR3_CHAT1_A_3 = ~z~I'm fine with losing chickens.

WAR3_CHAT1_A_4 = ~z~But I lost a leg already, and I got to pull down my pants to shit in these woods, so...

WAR3_CHAT1_A_5 = ~z~Yeah... you don't want to lose that.

WAR3_CHAT1_J_1 = ~z~We don't get her, what's the worst that can happen?

WAR3_CHAT1_J_2 = ~z~She runs off with a chicken?

WAR3_CHAT1_J_3 = ~z~I'm fine with losing chickens.

WAR3_CHAT1_J_4 = ~z~But I lost a leg already, and I got to pull down my pants to shit in these woods, so...

WAR3_CHAT1_J_5 = ~z~Yeah... you don't want to lose that.

WAR3_DIR0_1 = ~z~Quick. While we got eyes on her.

WAR3_DIR2_1 = ~z~Damnit... too slow. It looks like she's headed into the woodland.

WAR3_DIR3_1 = ~z~We're going to have to track her through the scrub. Better to be on foot.

WAR3_DIR3_2 = ~z~Send your horse somewhere safe.

WAR3_FIGHT0_01 = ~z~The whole pack!

WAR3_FIGHT0_02 = ~z~Stand your ground!
