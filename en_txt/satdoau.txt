SATDO_M5_ALVE_M_03 = ~z~These ones aren't going to behave, I can feel it.

SATDO_M5_ALVE_M_04 = ~z~If these ones get free, they are going to kill me...

SATDO_M5_ALVE_M_05 = ~z~Just a short drive. Watch over me, Santa Maria...

SATDO_M5_ALVE_S_01 = ~z~Oh, I heard of this one.

SATDO_M5_ALVE_S_02 = ~z~Those ropes are... tight, yes?

SATDO_M5_DEAD_S_02 = ~z~In there. Just don't touch me with it...

SATDO_M5_DEAD_S_03 = ~z~In here. What the hell am I doing with my life?

SATDO_M5_DEAD_S_04 = ~z~Did you close the eyes? I hate it when they stare at me.
