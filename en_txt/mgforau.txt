MGFOR_SW_SDKA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Then how's about robbing folk?~sl:1.1~Folk who'd rob you of everything if they could...

MGFOR_SW_SDKA_2 = ~z~These Lemoyne Raiders would be well advised to stay out of Saint Denis.

MGFOR_SW_SDKA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~But they haven't, and what's more...~sl:0.6~they brought valuable stock to town, which we are going to liberate from them.

MGFOR_SW_SDKA_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~You'll find them down at the docks...~sl:0.9~the cargo will be loaded up, good to go.
