LCMPF_IG1_2 = ~z~Ain't you raised enough hell around here?

LCMPF_IG1_ALTR_1 = ~z~There ain't nothing for you here.

LCMPF_IG1_ALT_1 = ~z~Hey, you get the hell away from here! We don't need you causing anymore trouble.

LCMPF_IG1_R_1 = ~z~Just leave us alone. We're done.

LCMPF_IG3_1 = ~z~Timber!

LCMPF_IG_TFAIM_01 = ~z~Oh, God!

LCMPF_IG_TFAIM_02 = ~z~What... what are you doing?

LCMPF_IG_TFAIM_03 = ~z~No, I ain't ready yet!

LCMPF_IG_TFATK_01 = ~z~Oh God, no!

LCMPF_IG_TFATK_02 = ~z~You're crazy!

LCMPF_IG_TFATK_03 = ~z~What the hell?

LCMPF_IG_TFPLRN_1 = ~z~You better start praying for a miracle.

LCMPF_IG_TFPLRN_2 = ~z~You think I don't know that? I'm done for!

LCMPF_IG_TFPLRP_1 = ~z~That foreman's a real bastard, ain't he? Here, this should help you get back on your feet.

LCMPF_IG_TFPLRP_2 = ~z~Thanks, mister. You're a good man.

LCMPF_IG_TFR1N_1 = ~z~That leg is just gone.

LCMPF_IG_TFR1N_2 = ~z~Yeah... I know...

LCMPF_IG_TFR1P_1 = ~z~You gonna be alright there?

LCMPF_IG_TFR1P_2 = ~z~I think so...

LCMPF_IG_TFR2N_1 = ~z~If a tree falls on some feller in the woods... then that feller gets left all alone... did that feller ever exist?

LCMPF_IG_TFR2N_2 = ~z~Why would you say that?

LCMPF_IG_TFR2P_1 = ~z~Alright, take care of yourself.

LCMPF_IG_TFR2P_2 = ~z~Thanks, mister.

LCMPF_IG_TFRSH_1 = ~z~Thank you for your help, mister. I don't know what I'm gonna do now.

LCMP_AGGRO3_1 = ~z~That's it, you're done.

LCMP_AGGRO4_1 = ~z~You get the hell out of here right now.

LCMP_ANGRRES1_1 = ~z~Now, is that any way to welcome a friend? Such a lack of hospitality.

LCMP_ANGRRES2_1 = ~z~Alright, don't get your bonnet in a twist. Just passing through.

LCMP_ANGR_2_1 = ~z~I ain't gonna tell you again, now get out of here.

LCMP_BODY1_1 = ~z~I hope you got a real good reason to be carrying that around.

LCMP_BODY2_1 = ~z~I got my eye on you.

LCMP_FMN_EOS_1 = ~z~All right, dinner time. You can pack it in now.

LCMP_FP_FPART_1 = ~z~Don't mention it. Me and wolves go way back.

LCMP_FP_LATER_1 = ~z~If you come back in a day or so, we should have lumber for sale again.

LCMP_GOODBYE_1 = ~z~I'm leaving. Don't work too hard.

LCMP_GOODBYE_2 = ~z~There ain't much danger of that with this bunch, my friend.

LCMP_IG_ACK_2_1 = ~z~Oh, welcome back again.

LCMP_IG_ACK_2_2 = ~z~We're going great guns here, now. Really coming together.

LCMP_IG_ACK_ACN_1 = ~z~Oh, hey. Can you believe those fools?

LCMP_IG_ACK_ACN_2 = ~z~You'd think they'd have learned to get out of the way of a tree by now.

LCMP_IG_ACK_ACP_1 = ~z~Oh. Thanks again for your help.

LCMP_IG_ACK_ACP_2 = ~z~Half these workers don't know their ass from their armpit.

LCMP_IG_FPACT2A_1 = ~z~Alright, you lazy bastards. You get back to work, first thing in the morning.

LCMP_IG_FPACT2A_2 = ~z~The wolves are gone, so no more excuses.

LCMP_IG_FPACT2_1 = ~z~Alright, you lazy bastards. Get back to work. Now!

LCMP_IG_FPACT2_2 = ~z~The wolves are gone, so no more excuses.

LCMP_IG_FPDW_1 = ~z~You not gonna take the money?

LCMP_IG_FPDW_2 = ~z~ It's up to you.

LCMP_IG_FPGNB_1 = ~z~There you are.

LCMP_IG_FPGNB_2 = ~z~Can I assume this trophy means you've taken care of them all?

LCMP_IG_FPGNB_3 = ~z~Yep, it's done.

LCMP_IG_FPGNC_1 = ~z~There you are.

LCMP_IG_FPGNC_2 = ~z~Please tell me there are dead wolves

LCMP_IG_FPGNC_3 = ~z~and not just a dead's man corpse to show for this?

LCMP_IG_FPGNC_4 = ~z~Yep, it's done.

LCMP_IG_FPGND_1 = ~z~There you are.

LCMP_IG_FPGND_2 = ~z~I take it that wolf pelt you're carrying means you've got some good news for me?

LCMP_IG_FPGND_3 = ~z~Yep, it's done.

LCMP_IG_FPGN_1 = ~z~There you are!

LCMP_IG_FPGN_2 = ~z~I assumed from all the

LCMP_IG_FPGN_3 = ~z~gunshots and howling, you got some good news for me?

LCMP_IG_FPGN_4 = ~z~Yep, it's done.

LCMP_IG_FPMT_1 = ~z~That's a relief, I'll tell ya.

LCMP_IG_FPMT_2 = ~z~Excellent work.

LCMP_IG_FPMT_3 = ~z~Money's right there on the table.

LCMP_IG_NI2N_1 = ~z~I ain't here for any of your damn trees, alright?

LCMP_IG_NI2N_2 = ~z~Alright, well, just make sure none of them fall on you, then.

LCMP_IG_NIACT1_1 = ~z~Ah, look who it is.

LCMP_IG_NIACT2_1 = ~z~Guess I'll come back some other time.

LCMP_IG_NIACTB_1 = ~z~I'm sorry but I don't have anything for you right now.

LCMP_IG_NIACTB_2 = ~z~We're good on supplies.

LCMP_IG_NIACTB_3 = ~z~We run out of lumber a couple of hours ago!

LCMP_IG_NIBA_1 = ~z~Back again?

LCMP_IG_NICL_1 = ~z~You don't really need to keep checking up on us.

LCMP_IG_NICL_2 = ~z~I got this whole operation running like clockwork.

LCMP_IG_NIFM_1 = ~z~If you say so. Could've fooled me.

LCMP_IG_NIFN_1 = ~z~I can go wherever I please.

LCMP_IG_NIFN_2 = ~z~Okay, I don't need this kind of aggravation right now.

LCMP_IG_NOAIN_1 = ~z~That you ain't...

LCMP_IG_NOAIN_2 = ~z~Alright then.

LCMP_IG_NOG_1 = ~z~Good to see ya!

LCMP_IG_NOG_2 = ~z~Operation's looking pretty good, huh?

LCMP_IG_NOG_3 = ~z~We don't need any supplies for the time being and,

LCMP_IG_NOG_4 = ~z~I'm afraid all our lumber's already spoken for.

LCMP_IG_NOG_5 = ~z~Oh, you can check back with us later though.

LCMP_IG_NOSEE_1 = ~z~Alright, we'll see then.

LCMP_IG_NOTI_1 = ~z~Well, I know I said come back later but,

LCMP_IG_NOTI_2 = ~z~you got to give us a little bit more time here.

LCMP_IG_NOTI_3 = ~z~I ain't no miracle worker.

LCMP_IG_S2ACK_1 = ~z~Oh! I thought I'd see you again.

LCMP_IG_S2ACK_2 = ~z~Pretty impressive out there, huh?

LCMP_IG_S2AL_1 = ~z~Alright, I'll take it.

LCMP_IG_S2BFM_1 = ~z~Back for some lumber, I assume?

LCMP_IG_S2BFM_2 = ~z~I got a wagon out front, already loaded up and ready to go.

LCMP_IG_S2BFM_3 = ~z~For you? Let's call it, eh, seventy-five dollars?

LCMP_IG_S2BFM_4 = ~z~You won't beat that price anywhere.

LCMP_IG_S2MNT_1 = ~z~Alright, well, we'll be here if you change your mind.

LCMP_IG_S2OT_1 = ~z~Maybe some other time.

LCMP_IG_S2VG_1 = ~z~Very good...

LCMP_IG_S2VG_2 = ~z~The wagon's out front.

LCMP_IG_S2VG_3 = ~z~See you next time.

LCMP_IG_S3HELP_3 = ~z~These wolves have got me at the end of my rope.

LCMP_IG_S3MAN_1 = ~z~Oh... yes! Yes!

LCMP_IG_S3MAN_2 = ~z~Maybe you're the man I need.

LCMP_IG_S3MAN_3 = ~z~Can you believe these lazy lily livers?

LCMP_IG_S3MAN_4 = ~z~Refusing to work on account of a few little wolves.

LCMP_IG_S3_AW_1 = ~z~They've been attacking workers on the south side of the camp...

LCMP_IG_S3_AW_2 = ~z~We need a real man to get rid of them.

LCMP_IG_S3_AW_3 = ~z~What do you say?

LCMP_IG_S3_AW_4 = ~z~You'll be very well rewarded.

LCMP_IG_S3_NR_1 = ~z~

LCMP_IG_S3_NR_2 = ~z~Just think about it!

LCMP_IG_S3_PLNR_1 = ~z~This doesn't sound like any problem of mine.

LCMP_IG_S3_PR_1 = ~z~Alright. If you're paying,

LCMP_IG_S3_PR_2 = ~z~ I should be able to take care of that for you.

LCMP_IG_TFHEL_1 = ~z~~sl:4.1~It hurts so bad!

LCMP_IG_TFHLS_6 = ~z~Come on.

LCMP_IG_TFPLNF_1 = ~z~You treat your workers like shit.
