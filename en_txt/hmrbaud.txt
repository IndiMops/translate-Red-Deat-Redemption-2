RHB_ABEFORE_1 = ~z~You know, I've been here before.

RHB_ABEFORE_2 = ~z~Is that a problem?

RHB_ABEFORE_3 = ~z~No, just didn't realize you meant this place...

RHB_ADISOBEY_1 = ~z~What the hell, Arthur? I told you to hang back!

RHB_ADISOBEY_2 = ~z~Let's just deal with the rest of 'em.

RHB_CALL_DOOR_1 = ~z~Watch it! They're coming out!

RHB_CALL_GOIN_1 = ~z~Bastards are going inside!

RHB_CALL_INSDE_1 = ~z~Still got more inside!

RHB_CALL_LEFT_1 = ~z~Left of the house!

RHB_CALL_RIGHT_1 = ~z~Look out on the right!

RHB_CALL_WOODS_1 = ~z~We got more coming out of the woods!

RHB_DAWDLE_01 = ~z~What are you doing back there?

RHB_DAWDLE_02 = ~z~Will you get a move on?

RHB_DAWDLE_03 = ~z~Come on, hurry up!

RHB_DISMOUNT_1 = ~z~Let's leave the horses here and go the rest on foot. Don't want them to hear us coming.

RHB_FLEENOW_1 = ~z~Go. Get out of here and never come back.

RHB_FNSHLTR_1 = ~z~Alright, that'll have to wait. We're nearly there.

RHB_LOWYIELD_1 = ~z~Ah, dammit, there ain't much. I'm heading back to camp. Should have kept one alive...

RHB_NOISE_1_1 = ~z~Hey, keep it down!

RHB_NOISE_2_1 = ~z~How's that sneaking up on them?

RHB_NOISE_3_1 = ~z~Are you trying to ruin this? Cut it out.

RHB_NOISE_4_1 = ~z~For christ sakes, stop it!

RHB_OLAWFLEE_1 = ~z~You know what? Just get the hell outta here, and don't look back.

RHB_RIDE_1B_1 = ~z~So, what were you doing riding around up there anyway?

RHB_RIDE_1B_2 = ~z~Sniffing around, looking for a take. I got a long nose for these things.

RHB_RIDE_1B_3 = ~z~Dutch is always on at us to get out there and bring in money, ain't he?

RHB_RIDE_1B_4 = ~z~And rightly so.

RHB_RIDE_1B_5 = ~z~I ain't like some of them others back there, sitting around, waiting to be told. I go after it.

RHB_RIDE_1B_6 = ~z~I see you sitting around plenty.

RHB_RIDE_1B_7 = ~z~I mean, I don't need no coddling like the rest.

RHB_RIDE_1B_8 = ~z~Dutch knows my value to the cause, has from the moment I met him.

RHB_RIDE_1B_9 = ~z~You tried to kill him, if I remember the story right.

RHB_RIDE_1B_10 = ~z~And he kept me around, didn't he? He saw something in me, he's said as much.

RHB_RIDE_1B_11 = ~z~I'm sure. Dutch is good at seeing things in people.

RHB_RIDE_1B_12 = ~z~And while we're talking about money, you are clear on how this works?

RHB_RIDE_1B_13 = ~z~We split half, other half goes to the gang. Dutch keeps all our savings hidden in a safe spot outside camp.

RHB_RIDE_1B_14 = ~z~Yeah, yeah, I know...how many times do you have to tell me?

RHB_RIDE_1B_15 = ~z~But what's that box by his tent for then?

RHB_RIDE_1B_16 = ~z~Camp funds...supplies and the like.

RHB_RIDE_1B_17 = ~z~The fact you don't know that suggests you clearly ain't put much in it.

RHB_RIDE_1B_18 = ~z~I always pay my way, don't you worry.

RHB_RIDE_1_1 = ~z~How far is this place?

RHB_RIDE_1_2 = ~z~It's a bit of a ride, not too bad. Back up north a stretch, not far from the state line.

RHB_RIDE_1_3 = ~z~Alright.

RHB_RIDE_2A_1 = ~z~You sure you scoped this place out right?

RHB_RIDE_2A_2 = ~z~Yes, see? That's why I wanted you along for this. You're still a doubter.

RHB_RIDE_2A_3 = ~z~I ain't just some dumb kid. I've lived a lifetime of shit already.

RHB_RIDE_2A_4 = ~z~And you sure don't keep it bottled up inside.

RHB_RIDE_2B_1 = ~z~You saw me in action on those tobacco fields. That worked out alright.

RHB_RIDE_2B_2 = ~z~I guess you could say that.

RHB_RIDE_2CSHOUTED_9 = ~z~Davey... was finished by the time we got up the mountains, Jenny didn't even make it that far.

RHB_RIDE_2CSPOKEN_9 = ~z~Davey was finished by the time we got up the mountains, Jenny didn't even make it that far.

RHB_RIDE_2C_1 = ~z~What about that train job with the oil wagon? Made a good showing there, didn't I?

RHB_RIDE_2C_2 = ~z~You got knocked out.

RHB_RIDE_2C_3 = ~z~That's what you choose to remember? We got paid, we got out of there.

RHB_RIDE_2C_4 = ~z~Got knocked out in Blackwater too, didn't you?

RHB_RIDE_2C_5 = ~z~Now that was bloody chaos.

RHB_RIDE_2C_6 = ~z~Did you get split off with Mac?

RHB_RIDE_2C_7 = ~z~No, didn't see him. I lost you boys at some point when he was getting out of town.

RHB_RIDE_2C_8 = ~z~They caught up with Mac a couple of days after.

RHB_RIDE_2C_10 = ~z~Those bounty hunters strung me up, beat me, pulled teeth, burned me feet...

RHB_RIDE_2C_11 = ~z~but I didn't breathe a word about nothing, I swear.

RHB_RIDE_2C_12 = ~z~Good.

RHB_RIDE_2C_13 = ~z~And it's time folks stopped giving Dutch a hard time about all that Blackwater business if you ask me.

RHB_RIDE_2C_14 = ~z~The man's not a fortune teller. You can plan, you can use your head,

RHB_RIDE_2C_15 = ~z~but you never really know what you're walking into.

RHB_RIDE_2C_16 = ~z~Yep, folks always want to blame someone when things go wrong.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT1SHOUTED_1 = ~z~Hey, you need this, Arthur. I don't even know what I'm seeing no more.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT1SHOUTED_2 = ~z~You and Dutch are deputies, you're out throwing lead with Sadie Adler...

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT1SPOKEN_1 = ~z~Hey, you need this, Arthur.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT1SPOKEN_2 = ~z~I don't even know what I'm seeing no more. You and Dutch are deputies, you're out throwing lead with Sadie Adler...

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT1_3 = ~z~I'm pulling you back on the rails here.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT2_1 = ~z~Hey, you need this, Arthur.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT2_2 = ~z~I don't even know what I'm hearing no more. Helping the law chase down criminals...

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT2_3 = ~z~I'm pulling you back on the rails here.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT3_1 = ~z~Hey, you need this, Arthur.

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT3_2 = ~z~I don't even know what I'm hearing no more...

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT3_3 = ~z~You're out throwing lead with Sadie Adler, helping the law chase down criminals...

RHB_RIDE_4_ALT3_4 = ~z~I'm pulling you back on the rails here.

RHB_RIDE_4_P1_1 = ~z~How far is it now?

RHB_RIDE_4_P1_2 = ~z~Not too much further.

RHB_RIDE_4_P1_3 = ~z~Better be worth it.

RHB_RIDE_4_P2_1 = ~z~Is that right? So ~rp~what's your plan?

RHB_RIDE_4_P2_2 = ~z~We'll go up, nice and quiet.~rp~ I'll give it a bit of patter, catch 'em off guard, then we take 'em.

RHB_RIDE_4_P2_3 = ~z~They might have the money hidden somewhere.

RHB_RIDE_4_P2_4 = ~z~I know, and we'll make them tell us where it is.

RHB_RIDE_4_P2_5 = ~z~Okay.

RHB_RIDE_4_P2_6 = ~z~Trust me, this is thinking smart. ~rp~Ripping off a bastard who's already done all the hard work.

RHB_RIDE_TIP1_1 = ~z~Hard left coming up.

RHB_RIDE_TIP2_1 = ~z~Alright, it's gonna be off the road up ahead.

RHB_RIDE_TIP3_1 = ~z~Up here, Morgan.

RHB_RSC1_1 = ~z~is your people err...

RHB_RSC1_1_1 = ~z~Yeah?

RHB_RSC1_1_2 = ~z~So, tell me...

RHB_RSC1_2 = ~z~Jacobites or English lovers, Arthur?

RHB_RSC1_3 = ~z~is your people err...

RHB_RSC1_4 = ~z~Jacobites or English lovers, Arthur?

RHB_RSC1_5 = ~z~is your people err...

RHB_RSC1_6 = ~z~Jacobites or English lovers, Arthur?

RHB_RSC1_7 = ~z~My people were peasants...

RHB_RSC1_8 = ~z~we had no time for politics.

RHB_RSC1_9 = ~z~My dad would say that no politics was politics.

RHB_RSC1_10 = ~z~That old world bullshit, it ain't got no place here.

RHB_RSC1_11 = ~z~Why?

RHB_RSC1_12 = ~z~Because there ain't no judgement here?

RHB_RSC1_13 = ~z~Most folks hate the Negroes...

RHB_RSC1_14 = ~z~they hate the Redskins, the Jews...

RHB_RSC1_15 = ~z~even us Irish.

RHB_RSC1_16 = ~z~You ain't so free of politics.

RHB_RSC1_17 = ~z~I hate everyone just the same.

RHB_RSC1_18 = ~z~Well, in that case...

RHB_RSC1_19 = ~z~you're gonna want what I just found for us.

RHB_RSC1_20 = ~z~What's that?

RHB_RSC1_21 = ~z~I was riding around, couple of days back...

RHB_RSC1_22 = ~z~and I come across this old cabin...

RHB_RSC1_23 = ~z~couple of fuckers lazing about outside...

RHB_RSC1_24 = ~z~all liquored up.

RHB_RSC1_25 = ~z~I didn't think nothing of it...

RHB_RSC1_26 = ~z~but then I come across this hunter down by the river...

RHB_RSC1_27 = ~z~and he tells me they're a stick-up crew.

RHB_RSC1_28 = ~z~Says they hit a train a couple of days back near Emerald Ranch.

RHB_RSC1_29 = ~z~Nice feller he was...

RHB_RSC1_30 = ~z~shared a bottle we did...

RHB_RSC1_31 = ~z~then I robbed the bastard blind.

RHB_RSC1_32 = ~z~And you believed him?

RHB_RSC1_33 = ~z~No reason not to.

RHB_RSC1_34 = ~z~If he's right it'll be a big haul for us.

RHB_RSC1_35 = ~z~I saw three of them, maybe more...

RHB_RSC1_36 = ~z~but I reckon you and me...

RHB_RSC1_37 = ~z~we could take them real easy.

RHB_RSC1_38 = ~z~Alright...

RHB_RSC1_39 = ~z~what the hell...

RHB_RSC1_40 = ~z~let's go check it out.

RHB_RSC1_41 = ~z~Them sons of bitches think they're mean...

RHB_RSC1_42 = ~z~they're about to get a lesson in mean.

RHB_RSC1_LI1_1 = ~z~Oh, hey Arthur.

RHB_RSC1_LO_1 = ~z~You just keep your cool, you hear me?

RHB_SGUARDS_1 = ~z~Alright, you go grab the money. I'll keep an eye on sunshine here.

RHB_SNFIND_1 = ~z~Hey, it's over there.

RHB_SNHURRY_1 = ~z~Find that thing yet? Don't want to overstay our welcome, do we?

RHB_SNRMNDS_1 = ~z~You heard him, right? He said the stash was behind a loose board in the bedroom.

RHB_SRCHCOM_1 = ~z~Told you we'd take 'em no problem, didn't I?

RHB_SRCHCOM_2 = ~z~You did good, but let's see what the pay is first.

RHB_SRCHCOM_3 = ~z~Dug this all up by myself. A proper lead.

RHB_SRCHCOM_4 = ~z~Alright, alright...

RHB_SRCHSHK_1 = ~z~Alright, guess we should give the place a look, see what we can find.

RHB_SSEARCH_1 = ~z~Why don't you see what else you can find, Sean?

RHB_SSPOT_1 = ~z~Look, there's one of them outside. This is good.

RHB_SSPOT_2 = ~z~It is?

RHB_SSPOT_3 = ~z~Leave it to me, I'll do the talking. You hang back.

RHB_WAITDMNT_01 = ~z~I said, leave the horses here.

RHB_WAITDMNT_02 = ~z~Come on, we're going on foot from here.

RHB_WAITDMNT_03 = ~z~Are you getting off that horse then?
