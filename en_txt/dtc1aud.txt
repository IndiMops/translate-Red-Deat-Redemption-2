DCH1_BANT1B_4 = ~z~I've only known him a few months, but... the way he talks, I never thought I'd see him wanting to head south.

DCH1_BANT1B_5 = ~z~Right... and ~rp~I know by now, there ain't no lying low.

DCH1_BANT1B_6 = ~z~There's too many of us for that.

DCH1_BANT1B_8 = ~z~Goes against everything he stands for.

DCH1_BANT1B_9 = ~z~That'd be admitting we're nothing more than low-down criminals.

DCH1_BANT1C_3 = ~z~The moving, the running...

DCH1_BANT1C_4 = ~z~Dutch don't see it as running.

DCH1_BANT1C_5 = ~z~Call it what you want.

DCH1_BANT2BSHOUTED_1 = ~z~So... ~rp~what happened with those Pinkertons, anyway? ~rp~When you were fishing with Jack?

DCH1_BANT2BSHOUTED_2 = ~z~Said they were onto us, ~rp~offered me freedom if I turned Dutch in.

DCH1_BANT2BSHOUTED_3 = ~z~They picked the wrong man there.

DCH1_BANT2BSHOUTED_5 = ~z~Bastards told me they'd killed Mac! Said it right in front of Jack!

DCH1_BANT2BSHOUTED_6 = ~z~That kid, it's gonna be tough for him.
