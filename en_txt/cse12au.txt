CSE12_ACT_1 = ~z~When we doing some reading?

CSE12_ACT_2 = ~z~Not now, Lenny, please. I've almost got it anyhow.

CSE12_ACT_3 = ~z~I told you I'd have you reading. Okay, now come on, I can't do it if you won't let me try.

CSE12_ACT_4 = ~z~Look, what's the point of reading anyhow? Just puts silly ideas in my head.

CSE12_ACT_5 = ~z~Exactly... that's the point of reading.

CSE12_ACT_6 = ~z~Another day, please.

CSE12_ACT_7 = ~z~Okay, but you can't avoid me forever.
