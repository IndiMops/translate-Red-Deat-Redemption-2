CSSN7_ACTA_ITF_3 = ~z~I don't know too much about time, Miss Grimshaw.

CSSN7_ACTA_ITF_4 = ~z~It's a bit beyond me.

CSSN7_ACTN_A_1 = ~z~It fades...

CSSN7_ACTN_A_2 = ~z~trust me, it fades.

CSSN7_ACTN_A_3 = ~z~What fades?

CSSN7_ACTN_A_4 = ~z~Your "youthful bloom".

CSSN7_ACTN_A_5 = ~z~It fades and it's a horror what's left.

CSSN7_ACTN_A_6 = ~z~Don't be like that Miss Grimshaw.

CSSN7_ACTN_A_7 = ~z~I know how you girls laugh at me.

CSSN7_ACTN_A_8 = ~z~I used to laugh at women just like me when I was young and pretty and sure of the world.
