CAHSO_ABICALL2_1 = ~z~Jack! Jack! Where did you get to?

CAHSO_ABICALL2_2 = ~z~I'm right here, Momma!

CAHSO_ABICALL3_1 = ~z~Jack! Where have you wandered off to?

CAHSO_ABICALL3_2 = ~z~I'm over here!

CAHSO_ABICALL4_1 = ~z~Jack! Jack! Where are you?

CAHSO_ABICALL4_2 = ~z~Right here, Momma!

CAHSO_BAI1_1 = ~z~The big man!

CAHSO_BAI1_2 = ~z~Shut up.

CAHSO_BAI1_3 = ~z~Charming!

CAHSO_BAI2_1 = ~z~Smile, Arthur, it's a beautiful day.

CAHSO_BAI2_2 = ~z~Why don't you go make yourself useful?

CAHSO_BAI2_3 = ~z~All in good time...

CAHSO_BAI3_1 = ~z~When are you gonna get off your ass and do something?

CAHSO_BAI3_2 = ~z~I'm pacing myself, Arthur.

CAHSO_BAI4_1 = ~z~Arthur Morgan! King among men...

CAHSO_BAI4_2 = ~z~King among fools, more like...

CAHSO_BAI5_1 = ~z~Arthur, stop pretending to look busy and sit down.

CAHSO_BAI5_2 = ~z~Yeah, you got that down to a fine art.

CAHSO_BAM1_1 = ~z~I just wanted to say... you know that problem with the dynamite at the train?

CAHSO_BAM1_2 = ~z~Yeah, yeah, it's done now. I won't mention it again.

CAHSO_BAM1_3 = ~z~You will, you bastard.

CAHSO_BAM2_1 = ~z~Sure beats freezing up on that mountain.

CAHSO_BAM2_2 = ~z~Yes, it does.

CAHSO_BAM3_1 = ~z~I seen you, sniffing around after Abigail.

CAHSO_BAM3_2 = ~z~Oh shut up.

CAHSO_BAM3_3 = ~z~Okay...

CAHSO_BAM4_1 = ~z~You know... that was a hell of a fight you had with that Tommy feller in town.

CAHSO_BAM4_2 = ~z~I needed some entertainment after all we'd been through.

CAHSO_BAM4_3 = ~z~Glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for starting all that, by the way.

CAHSO_BAM4_4 = ~z~Any time.

CAHSO_BAM5_1 = ~z~You seen the way Charles been acting... reckon he's still sore about me knocking him out?

CAHSO_BAM5_2 = ~z~You hardly knocked him out.

CAHSO_BAM5_3 = ~z~Yeah, yeah.

CAHSO_BHS1_1 = ~z~So here's another one for you, Hosea.

CAHSO_BHS1_2 = ~z~Horse walks into a saloon, bartender turns to him and says, "Why the long face?"

CAHSO_BHS1_3 = ~z~Oh it just gets worse.

CAHSO_BHSCOFF_1 = ~z~What are you reading?

CAHSO_BHSCOFF_2 = ~z~Nothing you'd like.

CAHSO_BHSCOFF_3 = ~z~Well pardon me for breathing.

CAHSO_BHSE1_1 = ~z~Hey, you ever eaten donkey, Hosea?

CAHSO_BHSE1_2 = ~z~No.

CAHSO_BHSE1_3 = ~z~Me neither.

CAHSO_BHSE1_4 = ~z~~sl:1.8~Strange man.

CAHSO_BJM1_1 = ~z~Ah, what I'd do for a hot bath and a good rubdown.

CAHSO_BJM1_2 = ~z~I sure hope that ain't a proposition.

CAHSO_BKSLACK_1 = ~z~Put your back into it, Karen.

CAHSO_BKSLACK_2 = ~z~And you wonder why no woman'll even look at you.

CAHSO_BL_PARTY1_1 = ~z~

CAHSO_BL_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Can we drink now, please?

CAHSO_BL_PARTY3_1 = ~z~I am ready to let loose tonight. Been too long.

CAHSO_BL_PARTY3_2 = ~z~You're always ready to let loose, Marston.

CAHSO_BL_PARTY3_3 = ~z~Well life's too short.

CAHSO_BL_PARTY4_1 = ~z~You better go easy, Marston. Family man now.

CAHSO_BL_PARTY4_2 = ~z~Right... I don't think so. Tonight's all about having fun. Macguire's back.

CAHSO_BL_PARTY4_3 = ~z~And don't we know it.

CAHSO_BSEM1_1 = ~z~You know, I was thinking of having a day off the whiskey.

CAHSO_BSEM1_2 = ~z~Why?

CAHSO_BSEM1_3 = ~z~You're right, forget I said it...

CAHSO_BSTRE1_1 = ~z~So what do they eat in Germany, Strauss?

CAHSO_BSTRE1_2 = ~z~I'm Austrian.

CAHSO_BSTRE1_3 = ~z~So what do they eat in Australia?

CAHSO_BSTRE1_4 = ~z~It's a miracle you don't fall over more.

CAHSO_BSWM1_1 = ~z~If you're wondering what that unholy smell is, Reverend, I am responsible.

CAHSO_BSWM1_2 = ~z~I thought it was some animal, and I was right.

CAHSO_BUE1_1 = ~z~Always the first in the food line, aren't you?

CAHSO_BUE1_2 = ~z~You ain't far behind me.

CAHSO_CHAMOONR1_1 = ~z~Got that moonshine for you.

CAHSO_CHAMOONR1_2 = ~z~Okay, thanks, I'll make some arrows for you later.

CAHSO_CHAMOONR1_3 = ~z~Sounds good.

CAHSO_CHAMOONR2_1 = ~z~Hey Arthur, I left those arrows by your tent.

CAHSO_CHAMOONR2_2 = ~z~Appreciate it.

CAHSO_DUTMOL1_1 = ~z~I love you, Dutch.

CAHSO_DUTMOL1_2 = ~z~Thank you, my dear.

CAHSO_DUTMOL2_1 = ~z~How about we take a walk later, just me and you?

CAHSO_DUTMOL2_2 = ~z~We'll see... perhaps.

CAHSO_DUTMOL3_1 = ~z~Are you mad at me?

CAHSO_DUTMOL3_2 = ~z~No, I'm just trying to think.

CAHSO_DUTMOL4_1 = ~z~What's wrong? You've barely looked at me.

CAHSO_DUTMOL4_2 = ~z~I have a lot to think about right now, okay?

CAHSO_DUTMOL4_3 = ~z~Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

CAHSO_DU_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Hey, there you are.

CAHSO_DU_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Mr. Macguire is back. So, come on... let's have ourselves a party!

CAHSO_DU_PARTY3_1 = ~z~Come on, let's hear a song.

CAHSO_DU_PARTY4_1 = ~z~You know this one, don't you? Go join in.

CAHSO_DU_PARTY5_1 = ~z~Go get yourself a drink, you deserve one.

CAHSO_DU_PARTY6_1 = ~z~Very nice, but how about something a little more civilized?

CAHSO_ITMJAVA1_1 = ~z~Here, I picked up some Oleander. Is this enough?

CAHSO_ITMJAVA1_2 = ~z~Yeah, should be plenty. I'll get working on some more knives later.

CAHSO_ITMJAVA2_1 = ~z~Those knives are ready for you. I left them at your tent.

CAHSO_ITMJAVA2_2 = ~z~Thanks, Javier.

CAHSO_ITMPRSA1_1 = ~z~Caught a rabbit for you.

CAHSO_ITMPRSA1_2 = ~z~Ah perfect, thank you. I'll get started on that soup.

CAHSO_ITMPRSA2_1 = ~z~Soup is served, Arthur. Why don't you give it a taste?

CAHSO_JV_PARTY1_1 = ~z~I just can't get rid of you, can I?

CAHSO_KA1_1 = ~z~Sure is quiet without them Callander boys around.

CAHSO_KA1_2 = ~z~Yeah, damn shame.

CAHSO_KA1_3 = ~z~Spent all my time telling them to shut up, now I miss it.

CAHSO_KA2_1 = ~z~Just thinking about Jenny...

CAHSO_KA2_2 = ~z~of all the people to lose up there, she seemed so young, so strong.

CAHSO_KA2_3 = ~z~I know.

CAHSO_KA2_4 = ~z~Guess all we can do is move on.

CAHSO_KA3_1 = ~z~You know, I'll never forget that image of you boys bursting back in after Blackwater, all bloodied up.

CAHSO_KA3_2 = ~z~Well try to.

CAHSO_KA3_3 = ~z~That look in Dutch's eyes, never seen that before.

CAHSO_KA4_1 = ~z~Ain't so bad here... if I never see snow again, it'll be too soon.

CAHSO_KA4_2 = ~z~Yeah, we'll be alright now.

CAHSO_KA5_1 = ~z~So that Adler woman, she's sticking around?

CAHSO_KA5_2 = ~z~Looks that way, for now... you okay with that?

CAHSO_KA5_3 = ~z~Sure, I guess. She's had a tough time.

CAHSO_KAC_1 = ~z~Does yours taste burnt?

CAHSO_KAC_2 = ~z~It always tastes burnt to me.

CAHSO_KAJAV_1 = ~z~You ever think about going back to Mexico?

CAHSO_KAJAV_2 = ~z~I can't, at least not for now. It's a long story.

CAHSO_KAJAV_3 = ~z~I'd like to go there one day.

CAHSO_KAJHN_1 = ~z~So you going to do the right thing by Abigail?

CAHSO_KAJHN_2 = ~z~Don't you start too.

CAHSO_KAJHN_3 = ~z~Ain't fair on her or the boy.

CAHSO_KAMC_1 = ~z~Here we are, another day older.

CAHSO_KAMC_2 = ~z~And definitely not wiser.

CAHSO_KAM_1 = ~z~I wonder if I'll ever not smell of campfire again.

CAHSO_KAM_2 = ~z~I think it's in our skin now.

CAHSO_KASEAN_1 = ~z~See you, Karen, you're a real woman, not like these brittle bitches.

CAHSO_KASEAN_2 = ~z~Good to have you back, Sean.

CAHSO_KA_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Oh, please make it quick.

CAHSO_KA_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Are you drunk already?

CAHSO_KA_PARTY3_1 = ~z~

CAHSO_KA_PARTY4_1 = ~z~Yeah come on. Let's party.

CAHSO_KA_PARTY5_1 = ~z~Uh oh, here comes trouble.

CAHSO_KME_1 = ~z~Another night of fine dining under the stars.

CAHSO_KME_2 = ~z~Yes, indeed.

CAHSO_KMV_1 = ~z~How long do you think we'll be here?

CAHSO_KMV_2 = ~z~Who knows?

CAHSO_KMV_3 = ~z~Probably just until we start to get settled.

CAHSO_KTV_1 = ~z~Hope these boys know what they're doing.

CAHSO_KTV_2 = ~z~Me too.

CAHSO_LA1_1 = ~z~I was just thinking about that Cornwall train. You did good there.

CAHSO_LA1_2 = ~z~Nearly didn't make it.

CAHSO_LA1_3 = ~z~Made it more than the rest of them.

CAHSO_LA2_1 = ~z~You regretting falling in with us yet? Didn't figure we'd be on the run like this.

CAHSO_LA2_2 = ~z~I'd been on the run for a long time before this.

CAHSO_LA3_1 = ~z~You reckon Sean's gonna be okay?

CAHSO_LA3_2 = ~z~Who knows... I hope so. He usually is.

CAHSO_LA4_1 = ~z~Is that a journal I see you writing in?

CAHSO_LA4_2 = ~z~Something like that.

CAHSO_LA4_3 = ~z~That's good.

CAHSO_LA5_1 = ~z~This is what it's all about, ain't it?

CAHSO_LA5_2 = ~z~Is it?

CAHSO_LA5_3 = ~z~Look at this place, what more do we need?

CAHSO_MB_ITEM_1 = ~z~So I got hold of that fountain pen for you.

CAHSO_MB_ITEM_2 = ~z~Oh thank you, Arthur. Here, please take this. Something I acquired along the way.

CAHSO_MB_PARTY1_1 = ~z~

CAHSO_MB_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Oh, no speeches, please!

CAHSO_MB_PARTY3_1 = ~z~Yeah right!

CAHSO_MB_PARTY4_1 = ~z~Welcome back, Sean.

CAHSO_MB_PARTY5_1 = ~z~Hooray!

CAHSO_MB_PARTY6_1 = ~z~He'll be drinking till dawn now, I bet.

CAHSO_MB_PARTY6_2 = ~z~Oh let him have some fun, he's been through a lot.

CAHSO_MB_PARTY6_3 = ~z~I thought you Irish enjoyed a party, Molly?

CAHSO_MB_PARTY6_4 = ~z~I am enjoying it.

CAHSO_MB_PARTY6_5 = ~z~I just don't need to fall over drunk with the rest of them.

CAHSO_ML_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Oh please.

CAHSO_ML_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Did you get a bump on the head?

CAHSO_ML_PARTY3_1 = ~z~I'm sure you will.

CAHSO_PBM1_1 = ~z~You know, when I was in the navy...

CAHSO_PBM1_2 = ~z~Shut up about the navy. I was in the army, with the real men.

CAHSO_PBM1_3 = ~z~And you do like a real man.

CAHSO_PK_PKIER1_01 = ~z~Hey, can someone give me a hand over here?

CAHSO_PK_PKIER1_02 = ~z~Will someone come help me out here?

CAHSO_PK_PKIER1_03 = ~z~Can I get some help over here?

CAHSO_PK_PKIER1_04 = ~z~Has someone got a minute to help me out here?

CAHSO_PK_PKIER1_05 = ~z~Hey, I could use a hand over here!

CAHSO_PK_PKIER1_06 = ~z~Alright, I need one of you to give me a hand here!

CAHSO_POSTABI1_1 = ~z~What's this about Pinkertons showing up while you were fishing with Jack?

CAHSO_POSTABI1_2 = ~z~Yeah, it was lucky he was with me to be honest.

CAHSO_POSTABI1_3 = ~z~They told me they'd caught up with Mac, said they finished him off.

CAHSO_POSTABI1_4 = ~z~What bastards.

CAHSO_POSTABI1_5 = ~z~Yeah.

CAHSO_PR_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Didn't take you long!

CAHSO_PR_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Let's drink.

CAHSO_PR_PARTY3_1 = ~z~Yeah takes one to know one, Macguire.

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT1_1 = ~z~Finally some good news, hey?

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT1_2 = ~z~Indeed.

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT1_3 = ~z~I was fearing the worst.

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT1_4 = ~z~You usually do, my love.

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT2_1 = ~z~How many times have we heard this song?

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT2_2 = ~z~It's a good one.

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT3_1 = ~z~Can't we put some music on?

CAHSO_PTY_DMBT3_2 = ~z~I will in a bit.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC1_1 = ~z~Would you like to dance, my dear?

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC1_2 = ~z~I'd love to.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC2_1 = ~z~Look at me, with the belle of the ball.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC2_2 = ~z~Oh stop it, you.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC3_1 = ~z~Feels like ages since we've done this.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC3_2 = ~z~Things are on the up again finally.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC4_1 = ~z~

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC5_1 = ~z~Well, thank you, sir.

CAHSO_PTY_DMDC5_2 = ~z~But of course...

CAHSO_SEAN_ITM_1 = ~z~Here's some whiskey, if you can make me some of those fire bottles.

CAHSO_SEAN_ITM_2 = ~z~Okay 'course, anything for you, English. Shouldn't take me too long. I'll leave them by your tent.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Mind if you join you fine folks?

CAHSO_SN_PARTY1_2 = ~z~I suppose.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY1_3 = ~z~You are looking lovely as ever, if I may say so.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY1_4 = ~z~Oh stop it.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY1_5 = ~z~Imagine riding with him all the way from Blackwater to here.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY2_1 = ~z~So what now?

CAHSO_SN_PARTY2_2 = ~z~Come on, how about a song?

CAHSO_SN_PARTY3_1 = ~z~Ah, it's good to be back.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY3_2 = ~z~I even missed you, you old bastard.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY3_3 = ~z~And I missed a good excuse to celebrate.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY3_4 = ~z~Me and you never need one of those, Uncle.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY4_1 = ~z~I didn't think we was going to see you again.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY4_2 = ~z~Ah, it'll take more than that to take down Sean Macguire. A hundred bounty hunters, there were.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY4_3 = ~z~Is that right?

CAHSO_SN_PARTY5_1 = ~z~Can't take her eyes off me, that Karen, can she?

CAHSO_SN_PARTY5_2 = ~z~I hadn't noticed.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY5_3 = ~z~And can you blame her?

CAHSO_SN_PARTY5_4 = ~z~The delusions of youth.

CAHSO_SN_PARTY6_1 = ~z~What are you doing there, you old creep?

CAHSO_SUBSLACK_1 = ~z~Comfortable there, Bill?

CAHSO_SUBSLACK_2 = ~z~I'd help you but that's woman's work.

CAHSO_SUBSLACK_3 = ~z~What a pathetic excuse for a man you are.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL1_01 = ~z~Come on girls, up and at 'em.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL1_02 = ~z~Enough lazing about, girl. Time for work.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL1_03 = ~z~Chop chop ladies, work to be done.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL1_04 = ~z~Time to get to work, ladies!

CAHSO_SUS_CALL1_05 = ~z~Idle hands, girls! Work time.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_01 = ~z~Put your backs into it.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_02 = ~z~No slacking, girls.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_03 = ~z~Let's pick up the pace there, ladies

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_04 = ~z~I've got my eye on you, girls.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_05 = ~z~Put some effort into it, girls.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_06 = ~z~Look lively, ladies.

CAHSO_SUS_CALL2_07 = ~z~No slacking over there, ladies.

CAHSO_SU_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Mr. Macguire.

CAHSO_SU_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Oh sit down, you fool!

CAHSO_SU_PARTY3_1 = ~z~Somebody needs to.

CAHSO_SU_PARTY4_1 = ~z~We intend to.

CAHSO_SU_PARTY5_1 = ~z~Come on! Let's enjoy ourselves!

CAHSO_TL_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Sean!

CAHSO_TL_PARTY2_1 = ~z~Here we go!

CAHSO_TL_PARTY3_1 = ~z~I'd like to see you try.

CAHSO_TL_PARTY4_1 = ~z~Yeah Sean!

CAHSO_TL_PARTY5_1 = ~z~Well said!

CAHSO_UN_PARTY1_1 = ~z~Oh here we go.

CAHSO_UN_PARTY2_1 = ~z~You got that right.

CAHSO_WAGREM1_1 = ~z~Hey, any luck finding us an oil wagon?

CAHSO_WAGREM1_2 = ~z~Not yet. I'll get to it, don't worry.

CAHSO_WAGREM2_1 = ~z~So what's happening with this oil wagon for the train job, Morgan?

CAHSO_WAGREM2_2 = ~z~Should we put someone else on it?

CAHSO_WAGREM2_3 = ~z~No, no, I said I'll handle it. We still got time.

CAHSO_WAGREM2_4 = ~z~Sure, but it's starting to run out.

CAMB_HSO_CJO1_A_1 = ~z~I've always liked fixing things.

CAMB_HSO_CJO1_A_2 = ~z~That's good, because we spend a lot of time breaking things.

CAMB_HSO_CJO1_B_1 = ~z~You know, you should teach the kid how to do this.

CAMB_HSO_CJO1_B_2 = ~z~Not you as well. God help me.

CAMB_HSO_CJO1_C_1 = ~z~I like working with you. You knuckle down, no yapping.

CAMB_HSO_CJO1_C_2 = ~z~No point talking unless there's something to say.

CAMB_HSO_CJO2_A_1 = ~z~You ever wonder sometimes what it'd be like just to... stay in one place?

CAMB_HSO_CJO2_A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.9~I haven't found that place yet.

CAMB_HSO_CJO3_A_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Bet you didn't think, six months ago, this is where you'd end up.~sl:0.4~On the run.

CAMB_HSO_CJO3_A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Well, maybe not right here, but the rest...~sl:1.1~I've been on the run my whole life.

CAMB_HSO_CJO3_B_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Just ain't the same without the Callander brothers.~sl:0.2~Never thought I'd miss those bastards.

CAMB_HSO_CJO3_B_2 = ~z~~sl:1.1~Me neither.

CAMB_HSO_CJO3_C_1 = ~z~You're a good worker. Most of 'em... can fix a drink, that's about it.

CAMB_HSO_CJO3_C_2 = ~z~~sl:0.9:0.0~I don't do well with sitting around for too long.

CAMB_HSO_CJ_A_1 = ~z~You don't say much, do you?

CAMB_HSO_CJ_A_2 = ~z~No...

CAMB_HSO_CJ_B_1 = ~z~This is not a meat I'm familiar with.

CAMB_HSO_CJ_B_2 = ~z~Best not to think too much about it.

CAMB_HSO_CJ_C_1 = ~z~You notice how every meal tastes the same?

CAMB_HSO_CJ_C_2 = ~z~It beats cooking your own food.

CAMB_HSO_CL_A_1 = ~z~~sl:1.0~A hot meal, good fire... what more do we need?

CAMB_HSO_CL_A_2 = ~z~That's right.

CAMB_HSO_CL_B_1 = ~z~I am starving. I could eat four bowls of this.

CAMB_HSO_CL_B_2 = ~z~I wouldn't recommend that.

CAMB_HSO_CL_C_1 = ~z~My ma used to make something just like this.

CAMB_HSO_CL_C_2 = ~z~She must have been a good woman... even if not the best cook.

CAMB_HSO_CL_C_3 = ~z~

CAMB_HSO_CS_A_1 = ~z~Well, this'll be pouring out of my arse in about half an hour.

CAMB_HSO_CS_A_2 = ~z~Oh... why do I need to know this?

CAMB_HSO_CS_B_1 = ~z~You ain't much company, are you? Come on, big feller, tell us a joke.

CAMB_HSO_CS_B_2 = ~z~Bill Williamson.

CAMB_HSO_CS_B_3 = ~z~

CAMB_HSO_CS_C_1 = ~z~Ah, there she blows.

CAMB_HSO_CS_C_2 = ~z~You're worse than a child.

CAMB_HSO_HA_A_1 = ~z~You're quiet, Hosea.

CAMB_HSO_HA_A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~Quiet is good.~sl:1.1~We don't get enough of it.

CAMB_HSO_HA_B_1 = ~z~How many hours of our lives have we wasted, staring into a fire?

CAMB_HSO_HA_B_2 = ~z~Those aren't wasted hours, my dear. Quite the opposite.

CAMB_HSO_HA_C_1 = ~z~I'll miss sitting with you, Abigail, when... you know.

CAMB_HSO_HA_C_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Stop talking like that.~sl:0.8~I already told you.

CAMB_HSO_HA_D_1 = ~z~Are you alright? You haven't said much.

CAMB_HSO_HA_D_2 = ~z~Just thinking, that's all.

CAMB_HSO_HS_A_1 = ~z~This is about my only vice these days.

CAMB_HSO_HS_A_2 = ~z~Not your only vice.

CAMB_HSO_HS_B_1 = ~z~How are the coffers looking? Any fuller?

CAMB_HSO_HS_B_2 = ~z~Never full enough.

CAMB_HSO_HS_C_1 = ~z~Good cup of coffee and all is right with the world again.

CAMB_HSO_HS_C_2 = ~z~Best time of the day.

CAMB_HSO_HS_D_1 = ~z~One of these days I'll show you what real coffee is.

CAMB_HSO_HS_D_2 = ~z~I look forward to it.

CAMB_HSO_HS_E_1 = ~z~What do you think? Is it going to be a good day, Mr. Strauss?

CAMB_HSO_HS_E_2 = ~z~When did we last have a good day?

CAMB_HSO_HS_E_3 = ~z~True.

CAMB_HSO_JH_A_1 = ~z~Quite a view, huh, Jack?

CAMB_HSO_JH_A_2 = ~z~It sure is.

CAMB_HSO_JH_B_1 = ~z~We're not going to move again, are we, Uncle Hosea? I like it here.

CAMB_HSO_JH_B_2 = ~z~You might like the next place even better.

CAMB_HSO_JH_C_1 = ~z~I wish I could fly like those birds.

CAMB_HSO_JH_C_2 = ~z~One day soon you'll be able to. It's a new world.

CASHO_CHAMOONG2_1 = ~z~You know what, I got some moonshine right here.

CASHO_CHAMOONG2_2 = ~z~Okay, thanks, I'll make some arrows for you later.

CASHO_CHAMOONG2_3 = ~z~Sounds good.
