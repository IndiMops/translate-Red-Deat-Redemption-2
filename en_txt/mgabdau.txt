MGABD_ASN_PSSE_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~The kind of people who just...~sl:0.0:3.4~can't be reasoned with, for love nor money.~sl:0.5~It's taken quite a toll on us...

MGABD_ASN_PSSE_6 = ~z~~sl:0.2~Oh yes.

MGABD_ASN_PSSE_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~So, if you could track them down and...~sl:0.0:4.4~find a permanent solution to this unfortunate situation...~sl:0.5~we'd really appreciate it.

MGABD_ASN_PSSE_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5:1~I'd do it myself, but my nethers've been giving me hell.

MGABD_ASN_PSSE_9 = ~z~~sl:0.1:4.4:1~Yes, I'd say it's time for another liedown, honey pie.

MGABD_AST_HORC_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~These men... oh, folks can be so judgemental...~sl:0.3~but we will always choose love over hate, ain't that so, Bray?

MGABD_AST_HORC_6 = ~z~You betcha.

MGABD_AST_HORC_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.6~So... could you deal with these bastards for us... definitively?~sl:0.7~Last we heard, they're down near Hagen Orchards.

MGABD_AST_SORC_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~The friends of this feller?~sl:0.2~A bunch of inbred hillbilly folk.

MGABD_AST_SORC_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Feels like our only hope is to~sl:~try and get to them before they get to us.

MGABD_AST_SORC_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~If you could head up to Elysian Pool by Butcher Creek~sl:0.0:5.0~and deal with the bastards... well, maybe just for once,~sl:0.0:2.6:1~love and respect can prevail.

MGABD_BOUNTY_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Sorry honey, we heard you got a price on your head.~sl:0.2~That's trouble we don't need.

MGABD_BOUNTY_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Well, someone's been naughty... why don't you come back~sl:~when you've paid off your bounty?

MGABD_BOUNTY_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~You think we ain't heard about the price on your head?~sl:0.3~We can't be fraternizing with criminals, sweetie.

MGABD_B_ACT_AGG_01 = ~z~What are you doing?

MGABD_B_ACT_AGG_02 = ~z~Hey, there's no need for that.

MGABD_B_ACT_AGG_03 = ~z~Now you just calm yourself.

MGABD_B_AGGRESS_01 = ~z~You again? Hey, just leave us alone.

MGABD_B_AGGRESS_02 = ~z~Now, you just turn around and get the hell outta here.

MGABD_B_AGGRESS_03 = ~z~Hey, you ain't welcome here no more. Not after the way you acted.

MGABD_B_AIM_01 = ~z~Whoa now, why don't you put that down?

MGABD_B_APPRCH_07 = ~z~Oh hey, you're back.

MGABD_B_APPRCH_08 = ~z~Well look who it is, Tammy.

MGABD_B_BOUNTY_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Oh, hey there, uh... you know, we saw your face on a poster?~sl:~You're a little too famous for us right now.

MGABD_B_BOUNTY_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~No. Sorry, friend.~sl:0.3~You think we ain't heard about the price on your head?

MGABD_B_BOUNTY_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Sorry friend, but if you want work,~sl:0.0:2.3~you got to pay off that bounty first.~sl:~News travels fast 'round here.

MGABD_B_CLDOWN_01 = ~z~Sorry... I still ain't ready to forgive you yet.

MGABD_B_CLDOWN_02 = ~z~You must think we got a real short memory, friend.

MGABD_B_CLDOWN_03 = ~z~What do you want? I still ain't talking to you.

MGABD_B_ESCALTE_01 = ~z~Hey, that is enough!

MGABD_B_ESCALTE_02 = ~z~I ain't gonna tell you again.

MGABD_B_ESCALTE_03 = ~z~Who you think you are?

MGABD_B_FAIL_01 = ~z~Well, that could've gone better.

MGABD_B_FAIL_02 = ~z~Oh dear... you know we was really counting on you.

MGABD_B_FAIL_03 = ~z~Now that there is a real shame. I hate disappointing my Tammy.

MGABD_B_FAIL_LM_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Okay, looks like we might need to give this'un~sl:~another chance, Tammy.

MGABD_B_FAIL_LM_02 = ~z~Oh, look who's back... didn't go so well last time, huh?

MGABD_B_FAIL_LM_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~It's alright, no need to apologize.~sl:0.2~Hey, we all make mistakes.

MGABD_B_H_HIGH_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.8~My pa used to say, "When you wallow with pigs, you get stinky."~sl:0.2~And maybe you ain't ready for that.

MGABD_B_H_HIGH_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~We've been hearing good things about you.~sl:0.3~And “good” ain't exactly what we're looking for, right now.

MGABD_B_H_HIGH_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Sorry friend, I already got myself an angel here.~sl:0.4:2.1~We're looking for someone with a little more...~sl:0.6~fire and brimstone experience.

MGABD_B_H_LOW_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Sorry friend, we heard all about you.~sl:0.1~You're trouble, we don't need it right now.

MGABD_B_H_LOW_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Listen, friend, maybe you should go to confession~sl:~before coming 'round here again.

MGABD_B_IDLETME_01 = ~z~You should really get a move on.

MGABD_B_IDLETME_02 = ~z~Time ain't on our side here, friend.

MGABD_B_IDLETME_03 = ~z~I really wouldn't dilly-dally on this'un.

MGABD_B_IDLETME_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~Well, go on now.~sl:~What are you waiting for, a pinch on the backside?

MGABD_B_IDLETME_05 = ~z~I'd hurry if I was you. I do not need Tammy fretting.

MGABD_B_IDLE_01 = ~z~I reckon this one thinks they're moving in, Tammy.

MGABD_B_IDLE_02 = ~z~Well, like they say, the early hog gets the acorn.

MGABD_B_IDLE_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Well, if you wouldn't mind, friend...~sl:0.4~it is nearly time for our sponge bath.

MGABD_B_IDLE_04 = ~z~Well don't you let us keep you, friend.

MGABD_B_IDLE_05 = ~z~I do believe this one's sweet on you, Tammy. Wouldn't be the first.

MGABD_B_ILO_01 = ~z~Hey, don't ask me, speak to the lady of house.

MGABD_B_ILO_02 = ~z~You should probably speak to Tammy first. She is the boss.

MGABD_B_ILO_03 = ~z~If it's work you're after, speak to Tammy.

MGABD_B_ILO_04 = ~z~Okay, uh, so Tammy generally handles the business end of things.

MGABD_B_ILO_05 = ~z~It's best you speak to Tammy first. I'll only get it wrong.

MGABD_B_LEAVEN_01 = ~z~Well, don't let us keep you.

MGABD_B_LEAVEN_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~I think I know what you're really after...~sl:0.4~but Tammy is very tired today.

MGABD_B_LEAVEN_03 = ~z~Well, this one's got a hungry look in their eye, Tammy.

MGABD_B_LEAVEN_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Listen, why don't you come back later? No hard feelings.~sl:0.2~I'm saving all my pleasures for a little lady here.

MGABD_B_LEAVEN_05 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Well, we appreciate the social call, but uh...~sl:0.4~we have squirrel to mince.

MGABD_B_LEAVE_01 = ~z~Okay, you need to go, now!

MGABD_B_LEAVE_02 = ~z~It is time for you to leave, friend.

MGABD_B_LEAVE_03 = ~z~Will you just get the hell outta here?

MGABD_B_LEAVE_04 = ~z~Enough! Get out of our house.

MGABD_B_LEAVE_05 = ~z~Alright, you need to leave right now!

MGABD_B_LOCKED_01 = ~z~~sl:1.3:4.5:1~Well I'm sorry, we're about to be in the middle of something here.

MGABD_B_LOCKED_03 = ~z~Oh, hey, uh... I'm sorry, friend. Could you come back later?

MGABD_B_LOCKED_04 = ~z~~sl:0.7:3.6~You caught us with our pants down. Not literally, but...~sl:0.3~well, kinda... you know what, can you just come back?

MGABD_B_LOCKED_05 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Oh hey, sorry, you know what, this ain't a good time.~sl:~We're about to bone some possum.

MGABD_B_M_CLDWN_01 = ~z~Well you're keen. A little too keen, unfortunately.

MGABD_B_M_CLDWN_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You can't get enough, can you?~sl:0.2~Well, you'll just have to hold your horses, my friend.

MGABD_B_M_CLDWN_03 = ~z~Whoa there, take a break, friend. You'll work yourself to death.

MGABD_B_M_LOCK_01 = ~z~Hey, sorry, we ain't ready for you just yet.

MGABD_B_M_LOCK_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Hey, I reckon we'll need some more help soon, but...~sl:0.2~we don't have nothing for you right now.

MGABD_B_M_LOCK_03 = ~z~~sl:0.2:2.0~We're still working out a few details here,~sl:~can you come back and see us later?

MGABD_B_NOT_GL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Apologies, friend.~sl:~I reckon we need someone with a little more... seniority.

MGABD_B_NOT_GL_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Sorry, but uh...~sl:~I ain't sure we got anything suitable for you right now.

MGABD_B_NOT_GL_03 = ~z~Hey... you think we could speak to your boss first?

MGABD_B_NOT_GL_04 = ~z~Sorry friend, the cupboard is kinda bare right now.

MGABD_B_NOT_GL_05 = ~z~Hey, sorry. Much as we love a runt, right now we need a boss hog.

MGABD_B_NO_AVL_01 = ~z~Sorry, we ain't got nothing for you right now.

MGABD_B_NO_AVL_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Sorry, friend, things have finally quietened down 'round here,~sl:~thank the good Lord.

MGABD_B_NO_AVL_03 = ~z~Nothing doing right now, friend.

MGABD_B_PASS_01 = ~z~Oh, you little beauty.

MGABD_B_PASS_02 = ~z~Well, you sure know how to put a smile on a feller's face.

MGABD_B_PASS_03 = ~z~Oh, we are starting to like you.

MGABD_B_PASS_LM_01 = ~z~~sl:0.4~Would you look at this ray of sunshine, Tammy.

MGABD_B_PASS_LM_02 = ~z~Well hey, we are so very pleased with you.

MGABD_B_PASS_LM_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well done with that last little job.~sl:~I've half a mind to say let's open a bottle and all let loose.

MGABD_B_PSE_SML_01 = ~z~I reckon you're gonna need to find some more friends for this'un.

MGABD_B_PSE_SML_02 = ~z~Safety in numbers, friend. This is a big job.

MGABD_B_PSE_SML_03 = ~z~Can you round up a bigger posse? More the merrier and all that.

MGABD_B_PUSH_01 = ~z~Easy, now.

MGABD_B_PUSH_02 = ~z~Whoa there.

MGABD_B_PUSH_03 = ~z~~sl:0.4~No harm done.

MGABD_B_PUSH_04 = ~z~Oops.

MGABD_B_PUSH_05 = ~z~Hey now.

MGABD_B_PUSH_06 = ~z~Watch yourself, friend.

MGABD_B_RET_WO_01 = ~z~Now why would you tease us by coming back here empty-handed?

MGABD_B_RET_WO_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.1~Huh... now what is worse than strangers bearing gifts?~sl:0.9~Friends not bearing gifts.

MGABD_B_RET_WO_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Hey, what about that thing you were supposed to be helping~sl:~us with? Well, you ain't forgotten, have you?

MGABD_B_RET_W_01 = ~z~Oh, I could kiss you.

MGABD_B_RET_W_02 = ~z~~sl:0.4~Would you look at you, you absolute treat.

MGABD_B_RET_W_03 = ~z~This looks very promising, Tammy.

MGABD_B_SHOOT_01 = ~z~Hey!

MGABD_B_SHOOT_02 = ~z~What the hell?

MGABD_B_SHOOT_03 = ~z~Are you outta your mind?

MGABD_B_SHOOT_04 = ~z~What are you doing?

MGABD_B_SHOOT_05 = ~z~Well, shit!

MGABD_B_STREAK_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Well, look who it is, Tammy...~sl:0.1~just about our favorite person in the whole wide world.

MGABD_B_STREAK_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~If you were any more in our good books...~sl:0.1~this here would be a love story.

MGABD_B_STREAK_03 = ~z~Well, we couldn't be any happier with you.

MGABD_B_WANTED_01 = ~z~~sl:0.4:4.7~Hey, we are God-fearing folks here.~sl:~I mean, we can't be fraternizing with criminals.

MGABD_B_WANTED_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Hey, what's this? N-no, we don't know you.~sl:~Yeah, not with the law on your tail, anyway.

MGABD_B_WANTED_03 = ~z~Hey, what are you bringing the law 'round here for?

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.7~So, we need some help resolving an... awkward situation,~sl:0.2~to do with a so-called gentleman who was courting me.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_2 = ~z~Normally Bray would handle these matters, but...

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.2~But I just ain't as nimble as I used to be.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_4 = ~z~~sl:1.5:3.9:1~I don't know, you can be nimble when you wanna be.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_5 = ~z~~sl:1.2~And I won't stand for someone disrespecting my Tammy.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Especially some fancy dan~sl:~with a degenerate tolerance for narcotics.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~We heard he's in a convoy on his way~sl:~from Annesburg to Emerald Station.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Now, if you could apprehend some of them and bring 'em back here...~sl:5.7~Yup.

MGABD_CHK_EMRS_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9:1~Well, I think you know just how grateful we can be.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~So, we need some help with tracking down a few old friends,~sl:~or... ex-friends, over a terrible confusion.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.1~Terrible.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_3 = ~z~Story of my life.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_4 = ~z~~sl:0.2~Oh, Tammy.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_5 = ~z~And poor Bray's mobility ain't the best right now.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_6 = ~z~Oh, these damn trotters.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I rub his feet with dripping to no avail.~sl:0.2~I've taken to bathing him right there in that chair.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I ain't gonna lie, that is probably~sl:~the best night of the month for me.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_9 = ~z~~sl:0.9:5.2~Anyway, a couple of fellers we invited in and took care of,~sl:~now seem to have some grievance against us...

MGABD_CHK_LEM_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~over a simple medicinal error. Last we heard,~sl:~they're on their way up from Rhodes to Valentine.

MGABD_CHK_LEM_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.8:1~Could you go bring them back here so we can straighten this out?

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_1 = ~z~So, we could use your help with arranging a little reunion.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Sorry about the smell in here, by the way,~sl:~we had some goat tripe turn on us... must be the heat.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_3 = ~z~Yep, but it is all gone now, though. Waste not, want not, I say.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_4 = ~z~~sl:3.2:2.6:1~Hopefully we have better luck with this batch.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_5 = ~z~~sl:1.1:3.3~But yes, there was a misunderstanding...~sl:0.1:2.7~some fellers think we owe them money,~sl:0.1~they been threatening us.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_6 = ~z~Apparently, they're on their way south now towards Rhodes.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~If you could find them and bring 'em back here,~sl:0.0:3.9:1~well I'm sure we can clear up this mess once and for all.

MGABD_CHK_SCLT_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3:1~Folk can be so quick to judge, can't they?

MGABD_COOLDOWN_01 = ~z~I still don't think you're deserving of our hospitality.

MGABD_COOLDOWN_02 = ~z~You still ain't welcome here.

MGABD_COOLDOWN_03 = ~z~We still ain't forgotten what you did.

MGABD_ESCALATE_01 = ~z~You better stop that, right now.

MGABD_ESCALATE_02 = ~z~Alright, that's enough now.

MGABD_ESCALATE_03 = ~z~Alright, this ain't funny now.

MGABD_FAILED_LM_01 = ~z~Well, I hope you are here to redeem yourself.

MGABD_FAILED_LM_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Oh... it's you.~sl:0.4~You're lucky we're the forgiving types.

MGABD_FAILED_LM_03 = ~z~Well now, I hope you've got your tail between your legs.

MGABD_FAILED_LM_04 = ~z~~sl:1.3~I wasn't sure you'd even show your face back here again.

MGABD_FAILED_LM_05 = ~z~Oh hello, that last thing didn't go too well now, did it?

MGABD_FAIL_01 = ~z~Dear oh dear, maybe I was wrong about you.

MGABD_FAIL_02 = ~z~Well, that's very disappointing.

MGABD_FAIL_03 = ~z~No... just when I was starting to like you.

MGABD_G1_OUT_1 = ~z~Alright, so I need some help with a somewhat delicate matter...

MGABD_G1_OUT_2 = ~z~I know I can trust you.

MGABD_INT_25 = ~z~Mmm yeah, that is nice.

MGABD_INT_26 = ~z~Real silky.

MGABD_INT_27 = ~z~Now, we're just simple farmers.

MGABD_INT_28 = ~z~But uh...

MGABD_INT_32 = ~z~...and we can be real grateful.

MGABD_JB_SH_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0:1~Ended up spatchcocked like a chicken.

MGABD_JB_SH_4 = ~z~~sl:3.0~This really is a good year for squirrel.

MGABD_JB_SW_6 = ~z~~sl:0.2~For sanitary reasons.

MGABD_JB_SW_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~Yeah... well, I've been taking down the stairs like a...~sl:0.2:2.0:1~baby foal these days.

MGABD_JB_SW_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~So, if you could... acquire some wagons for us,~sl:~that would make our lives a lot easier.

MGABD_SH_LAKAY_2 = ~z~~sl:0.1:4.2~See, somebody, who shall remain nameless,~sl:~let the darn horses get loose. Ain't that right, Bray?

MGABD_SH_LAKAY_3 = ~z~~sl:0.2~Well now, I told you, I was sat right here, didn't hear nothing.

MGABD_SH_LAKAY_4 = ~z~~sl:0.2~Maybe if you had your face out of my pie for five minutes?

MGABD_SH_LAKAY_5 = ~z~~sl:0.4:5.3~Oh, well... that's like asking a man not to breathe, princess.~sl:0.7~But anyhow, I got an idea.

MGABD_SH_LAKAY_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~There's a creepy old place down in Lemoyne, Lakay it's called.~sl:0.1~It's full of outlaws and degenerates...

MGABD_SH_LAKAY_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well, you'd be doing the world a favor by relieving them~sl:0.0:2.6:1~of their poor horses, I'll tell you that for free.

MGABD_SW_CORN_6 = ~z~~sl:0.2:2.5:1~Well, just look at my belly.

MGABD_SW_CORN_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.9~But the trimmings still pile up... we've tried burning 'em out back,~sl:~but they just don't catch that well.

MGABD_SW_CORN_8 = ~z~~sl:0.3~And the smell? Strips the hair clean outta your nose, it does.

MGABD_SW_CORN_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.9~So, if you could source us some oil... a whole lot of oil,~sl:~we reckon that might help things along.

MGABD_SW_CORN_10 = ~z~There's wagon-loads of the stuff at Cornwall Kerosene and Tar.

MGABD_SW_CORN_11 = ~z~And I'm sure a rich feller like Mr. Cornwall won't miss one or two.
