MAR5_MCS5_5 = ~z~Not really.

MAR5_MCS5_6 = ~z~Can't build a fence, can't milk a cow...

MAR5_MCS5_7 = ~z~ain't used to shoveling shits...

MAR5_MCS5_8 = ~z~but took on a gang of robbers single handed.

MAR5_MCS5_9 = ~z~Guess we all got our peculiarities, Mr. Dickens.

MAR5_MCS5_10 = ~z~What was you doing before you came here?

MAR5_MCS5_11 = ~z~I told ya...

MAR5_MCS5_12 = ~z~wife got cheated out of inheritance...

MAR5_MCS5_13 = ~z~we was in a legal dispute.

MAR5_MCS5_14 = ~z~It was a bad time.

MAR5_MCS5_15 = ~z~Sounds awful...

MAR5_MCS5_16 = ~z~but I guess I don't believe a word of it.

MAR5_MCS5_17 = ~z~I was raised to take a man at his word...

MAR5_MCS5_18 = ~z~and also to believe this is a free country...

MAR5_MCS5_19 = ~z~so free that I can't tell you what to think.

MAR5_MCS5_20 = ~z~So I guess it don't much matter what you believe.

MAR5_MCS5_21 = ~z~But I will work hard...

MAR5_MCS7_24 = ~z~I'll see you later.

MAR5_MCS8_1 = ~z~I said, Abe, where are my other hands?

MAR5_MCS8_2 = ~z~I-I thought I said I don't rightly know, Mr. Geddes, sir...

MAR5_MCS8_3 = ~z~Well, what good is that to me?

MAR5_MCS8_5 = ~z~possibly more...

MAR5_MCS8_6 = ~z~a mare about to foal...

MAR5_MCS8_7 = ~z~and no hands to help with any of it.

MAR5_MCS8_8 = ~z~I'm supposed to be heading into town...

MAR5_MCS8_19 = ~z~He will insist on riding Jeremiah...

MAR5_MCS8_20 = ~z~a horse that is far too strong for him...

MAR5_MCS8_21 = ~z~and my wife will need help with this mare.

MAR5_MCS8_22 = ~z~Abe...

MAR5_MCS8_23 = ~z~you and Dickens better not make any more mistakes...

MAR5_MCS8_24 = ~z~like you did today, you hear?

MAR5_MCS8_25 = ~z~Sure.

MAR5_MCS8_26 = ~z~Thank you.

MAR5_MCS9_8 = ~z~yes, I do.

MAR5_MCS9_9 = ~z~It's a pretty big one...

MAR5_MCS9_10 = ~z~Jeremiah and I have a bond.

MAR5_MCS9_11 = ~z~You sure about that?

MAR5_MCS9_12 = ~z~Come on...

MAR5_MCS9_13 = ~z~easy boy...

MAR5_MCS9_14 = ~z~Someone put some onions on their oats...

MAR5_MCS9_15 = ~z~didn't they, boy?

MAR5_MCS9_16 = ~z~Calm down...

MAR5_MCS9_17 = ~z~He likes you!

MAR5_MCS9_18 = ~z~I ain't sure he likes any of us but...

MAR5_MCS9_19 = ~z~I'll make him respect me, and behave.

MAR5_MCS9_20 = ~z~Come on, here boy...

MAR5_MCS9_21 = ~z~You really should find a different horse to ride.

MAR5_MCS9_22 = ~z~I'm afraid that I will not.

MAR5_MCS9_23 = ~z~Then you'll regret it.

MAR5_MCS9_24 = ~z~Why's he like you so much?

MAR5_MCS9_25 = ~z~Can't you teach me how to make him behave...

MAR5_MCS9_26 = ~z~same way as he does for you?

MAR5_MCS9_27 = ~z~I'm supposed to go help your mother...

MAR5_MCS9_28 = ~z~she's got a horse in foal.

MAR5_MCS9_29 = ~z~That'll take hours.

MAR5_MCS9_30 = ~z~Well, training a horse can take hours.

MAR5_MCS9_31 = ~z~Just give me a quick lesson, sir.

MAR5_MCS9_32 = ~z~Please.

MAR5_MCS9_33 = ~z~Okay.

MAR5_MCS10_1 = ~z~So, you know much about birthing a foal, Milton?

MAR5_MCS10_2 = ~z~Not too much.

MAR5_MCS10_3 = ~z~My God.

MAR5_MCS10_15 = ~z~stick a hand in there and get a feeling for where the legs are.

MAR5_MCS10_16 = ~z~Go on.

MAR5_MCS10_17 = ~z~Whatever you say, ma'am.

MAR5_MCS10_LI_1 = ~z~So, you know much about birthing a foal, Milton?

MAR5_MCS11_1 = ~z~Okay, well I think she's...

MAR5_MCS11_2 = ~z~Well we're not out of the woods, but...

MAR5_MCS11_4 = ~z~Great.

MAR5_MCS11_5 = ~z~We'll make a proper hand of you yet, Mr. Milton.

MAR5_MCS11_6 = ~z~I hope so.

MAR5_MCS11_8 = ~z~Oh, and Mr. Milton...

MAR5_MCS11_9 = ~z~feel free to make a call at the house sometime.

MAR5_MCS11_10 = ~z~Perhaps even now?

MAR5_MCS11_11 = ~z~A drink to toast our new arrival.

MAR5_MCS11_12 = ~z~I'd like that, but...

MAR5_MCS11_13 = ~z~my wife is expecting me back.

MAR5_MCS11_14 = ~z~Oh, you're married?

MAR5_MCS11_15 = ~z~I didn't know we had any married hands.

MAR5_MCS11_16 = ~z~Yeah, we...

MAR5_MCS11_17 = ~z~we have a boy.

MAR5_MCS11_19 = ~z~Oh, uh...

MAR5_MCS11_20 = ~z~I'm, I'm busy...

MAR5_MCS11_21 = ~z~t-too busy for social calls.

MAR5_MCS13_11 = ~z~Not really.

MAR5_MCS13_12 = ~z~No...

MAR5_MCS13_13 = ~z~I don't guess it does.

MAR5_MCS13_14 = ~z~I don't remember much about it.
