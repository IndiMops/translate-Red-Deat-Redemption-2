MOON1_INT_4 = ~z~Interesting timing, wouldn't you say?

MOON1_INT_5 = ~z~Just as I get off my death bed.

MOON1_INT_6 = ~z~Still, probably our only chance to get him out.

MOON1_INT_7 = ~z~Well, the reason I heard is because the law's...

MOON1_INT_8 = ~z~moving another feller down to Sisika tomorrow.

MOON1_INT_9 = ~z~Weaselly money launderer by the name of Stan Reardon.

MOON1_INT_10 = ~z~And will be transferring him onto Lem's convoy...

MOON1_INT_11 = ~z~at some point on the route.

MOON1_INT_12 = ~z~I digress.

MOON1_INT_13 = ~z~I don't give a damn about Reardon.

MOON1_INT_14 = ~z~But if you can track down those lawmen...

MOON1_INT_15 = ~z~find out where the transfer's taking place...

MOON1_INT_16 = ~z~hopefully you can get the jump on 'em.

MOON1_LAW2MIN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Alright, they've had their chance.~sl:~Let's just head on to Sisika, we'll report this when we get in.

MOON1_LAW2MIN_2 = ~z~Maybe they ended up taking Reardon straight there.

MOON1_LAWALERT_1 = ~z~They must be here for the prisoner! Protect that wagon!

MOON1_LAWNSPOT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Okay, looks like the other convoy ain't arrived yet.~sl:0.5~Let's give them a few more minutes, then head on for Sisika.

MOON1_LAWNSPOT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~We were very clear about being on time.~sl:1.2~How's Mr. Fike doing back there? Still feeling sorry for himself?

MOON1_LAWSPOT_01 = ~z~Hey, move along! We need this location for official business.

MOON1_LCOMBAT_04 = ~z~Oh, we're in the shit now!

MOON1_LCOMBAT_05 = ~z~Oh, God, they'll pin all this on me, I know it!

MOON1_RBANT2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Well, this sure wasn't how I thought today was going to turn out.~rp~~sl:0.7~Aunt Maggie... I don't believe it.

MOON1_RBANT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I mean, part of me always held some hope...~sl:0.4:1.4~and there'd been rumors...~rp~~sl:0.4~that's why they decided to move me to Sisika...

MOON1_RBANT2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~figured if she was alive,~sl:~it might be the one thing to draw her in.

MOON1_RBANT2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Guess they were right...~rp~ problem is,~sl:0.4~they always did underestimate Aunt Maggie.

MOON1_RBANT2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Tough don't even begin to describe her.~rp~~sl:0.6~But... you probably know this already.

MOON1_RBANT2_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~She controlled the moonshine business in Lemoyne for years...~rp~~sl:0.5~'til the... government sent in that bastard Reid Hixon.

MOON1_RBANT2_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Most ruthless feller I ever crossed paths with.~rp~~sl:0.3:3.2~He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't curse, but...~sl:0.6~he is pure evil.

MOON1_RBANT2_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~The other Revenuers we could handle, but...~sl:~once Hixon was after us, we just couldn't get off the back foot.

MOON1_RBANT2_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Kept moving from place to place, but...~sl:0.0:1.8~it was only a matter of time before~sl:~he caught up with us at one of the cookhouses...

MOON1_RBANT_1 = ~z~I'm ready, let's go.

MOON1_REARCHECK_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~Watch out, it's a stick-up!~sl:0.4~Must have been them who stole the paperwork!

MOON1_ULOCKBOX_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Keep a good eye on that lockbox. ~sl:0.1~Last thing we want to do is lose Reardon's transfer papers.

MOON1_ULOCKBOX_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~I put the transfer document in the lockbox. Better safe than sorry. ~sl:~They rejected two prisoners last month.

MOON1_UPERSON_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I'm going to keep Reardon's transfer papers on me. ~sl:0.0:2.6~If we lose those before we meet up with the other convoy, ~sl:~we'll be stuck with him for another month.

MOON1_UPERSON_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~I'm just going to hold onto the transfer document until we meet up with the Sisika convoy. ~sl:~Wouldn't want our route falling into the wrong hands.

MOON1_UTABLE_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Have you read the transfer document yet?~sl:0.0:1.6~ On the table over there...~sl:1.1:2.5~Looks like a decent ride to the meeting point... ~sl:0.2~we should look to move out soon.

MOON1_UTABLE_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~I put the transfer papers on the table over there if you want to take a look.~sl:~Still got a decent ride ahead of us.
