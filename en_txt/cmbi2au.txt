CMBI2_ACTION_A_1 = ~z~Mary-Beth.

CMBI2_ACTION_A_2 = ~z~Hey Arthur.

CMBI2_ACTION_A_3 = ~z~How's the writing?

CMBI2_ACTION_A_4 = ~z~Not very good... I hear the most wonderful words in my head and then... I write absolute poppycock.

CMBI2_ACTION_A_5 = ~z~But I love it.

CMBI2_ACTION_B_1 = ~z~Yeah, me too.

CMBI2_ACTION_B_2 = ~z~My journal... I was reading some the other day...

CMBI2_ACTION_B_3 = ~z~

CMBI2_ACTION_B_4 = ~z~I write like a fool!

CMBI2_ACTION_B_5 = ~z~One day, I'd love a beautiful fountain pen and a... great desk in a quiet room and... to write the most beautiful stories.

CMBI2_ACTION_C_1 = ~z~Well, I can't do much about the stories or a quiet room, but maybe I'll find you a pen.

CMBI2_ACTION_C_2 = ~z~Thank you.
