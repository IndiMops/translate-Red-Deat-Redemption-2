CFSN2_ACT_1 = ~z~The first time I met Dutch, was him with Hosea...

CFSN2_ACT_2 = ~z~and I thought to myself, "What a pair of feckless bastards".

CFSN2_ACT_3 = ~z~Was up near North Elizabeth,

CFSN2_ACT_4 = ~z~and I was fixated on this pocket watch that Dutch had. Big fancy thing it was.

CFSN2_ACT_5 = ~z~I was a greedy bugger. And hungry too, I hadn't eaten in three days.

CFSN2_ACT_6 = ~z~So I thought to myself, I'll rob this pair of bastards. So I followed them out of the bar.

CFSN2_ACT_7 = ~z~It was a dark night and I followed them down this alleyway.

CFSN2_ACT_8 = ~z~As I pulled out my gun to threaten them with imminent death,

CFSN2_ACT_9 = ~z~they just stood there laughing at me... I felt like a six year old.

CFSN2_ACT_10 = ~z~Go ahead, they says, shoot us. So I did.

CFSN2_ACT_11 = ~z~Bang, bang, bang!

CFSN2_ACT_12 = ~z~Nothing... the bastards had spotted me at the bar and taken the bullets of my gun.

CFSN2_ACT_13 = ~z~So I stood there laughing, and crying and rather than kill me, they took me and got me some food.

CFSN2_ACT_14 = ~z~And that of course, was that.
