SAD3_BACKTORHD_2 = ~z~Second time lucky.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_3 = ~z~What you think, Cortez? ~rp~You got any more surprises up your sleeve?

SAD3_BACKTORHD_4 = ~z~You're a dead woman.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_5 = ~z~And you're a dead man!

SAD3_BACKTORHD_6 = ~z~The Del Lobos will not forgive this!

SAD3_BACKTORHD_7 = ~z~Where ever you hide, we will find you. And we will kill you. You, and anyone who's close to you.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_8 = ~z~I preferred it when you was offering money.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_9 = ~z~You want money? Hey, take my money. I got gold, lady.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_10 = ~z~But you was just saying you was going to kill me?

SAD3_BACKTORHD_12 = ~z~You see, Ramon, what we got here is a trust issue.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_13 = ~z~I'm good for it.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_14 = ~z~You're tied up on a horse, ~rp~about to be taken to Saint Denis to hang. ~rp~You ain't good for anything.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_15 = ~z~I swear.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_16 = ~z~Of course. ~rp~'Cause all you can do is swear. But you're just saying anything you think might get you out of this.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_17 = ~z~Ramon, ~rp~I couldn't trust you to pay me, ~rp~I couldn't trust you not to kill me.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_18 = ~z~Hell, ~rp~I couldn't even trust you to kill me, if that's what we agreed.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_19 = ~z~What the hell are you talking about? I got gold, woman, mister. Gold. Five thousand dollars!

SAD3_BACKTORHD_20 = ~z~I hope you left it to someone in your will.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_21 = ~z~'Cause you ain't going to find much use for it in the short time you got left.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_22 = ~z~Damn you, woman! Damn you.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_23 = ~z~Oh, I've been damned a long time, my friend.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_24 = ~z~Relax, mister. We ain't got far to go.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_25 = ~z~You made a big mistake, the both of you. You shoulda took the money.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_26 = ~z~You shoulda taken it... now we're gonna come for you. I promise you that. We're gonna come for you.

SAD3_BACKTORHD_27 = ~z~Well, I hope they know just where to find me, because I'll enjoy the fight.

SAD3_BLACKRIDESHOUTED_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Well, I gotta respect him for it, 'cause if I saw you walk...~sl:~into my lumber yard, ~rp~I'd think exactly the same thing.

SAD3_BLACKRIDESHOUTED_4 = ~z~~sl:0.9~Thinking about it... ~rp~I might actually do this on my own.

SAD3_BLACKRIDESHOUTED_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~No, no. You need someone with some sense to negotiate,~sl:~and some charm wouldn't hurt neither.

SAD3_BLACKRIDESHOUTED_8 = ~z~You're in enough debt as it is. ~rp~I gotta help you all I can.

SAD3_CORRAGE_5 = ~z~Be quiet.

SAD3_DEW1_1 = ~z~You've had some bad luck with bounties being stole off you.

SAD3_DEW1_2 = ~z~And you're about to have some back luck with getting punched in the face.

SAD3_DEW1_3 = ~z~He got stole off both of us.

SAD3_DEW1_4 = ~z~Someone must have talked.

SAD3_DEW1_5 = ~z~One of his 'boys' maybe.

SAD3_DEW1_6 = ~z~We were sitting ducks, waiting all that time in that gimcrack jail house.

SAD3_DEW1_7 = ~z~Yeah. Yes we were.

SAD3_DEW1_8 = ~z~I don't like it.

SAD3_DEW1_9 = ~z~The sheriff's done a lot to bring Rhodes into line since the time of the Grays and Braithwaites, but...

SAD3_DEW1_10 = ~z~clearly he ain't done enough.

SAD3_DEW1_11 = ~z~So you think we can trust him?

SAD3_DEW1_12 = ~z~Yeah. He'll pay up when we come back with Cortez. He's a decent feller.

SAD3_DEW1_13 = ~z~If we come back with Cortez.

SAD3_DEW1_14 = ~z~We're coming back with him. Don't you worry about that.

SAD3_DEW2SHOUTED_3 = ~z~If that kind of offer is tempting to you, ~rp~then go right ahead. But not when you're on one of my jobs.

SAD3_DEW2SPOKEN_3 = ~z~If that kind of offer is tempting to you,~rp~ then go right ahead. But not when you're on one of my jobs.

SAD3_DEW2_1 = ~z~It's an odd thing, isn't it? ~rp~We'll take two hundred dollars from a sheriff, ~rp~who might be crooked himself, to go get a bounty...

SAD3_DEW2_2 = ~z~but we won't take two thousand from an outlaw to just let them go.

SAD3_DEW2_4 = ~z~I never said I was tempted by it... ~rp~I just said it was an odd thing... ~rp~how we'd take money from one but not the other.

SAD3_DEW2_5 = ~z~Everyone's got to choose what they're loyal to... themselves, God, the State...

SAD3_DEW2_6 = ~z~if a bounty hunter wants to last, ~rp~that loyalty's got to be to the one that's issuing the bounties. ~rp~Plain and simple.

SAD3_DEW2_7 = ~z~I got a reputation for honest work.

SAD3_DEW2_8 = ~z~So everyone with a price on their head deserves it, you think?

SAD3_DEW2_9 = ~z~Sure... no... I don't know... usually.

SAD3_DEW2_10 = ~z~If I got into who deserved what, second-guessed every poster, ~rp~I'd tear out all my hair before I put a rope on anyone.

SAD3_DEW2_11 = ~z~If the price is high enough, you got to trust there's a reason they set it.

SAD3_DEW2_12 = ~z~I hope that rationale works out... for all of us.

SAD3_DEW3_1 = ~z~Hold up.

SAD3_DEW3_2 = ~z~Down there. A fire. I'd wager that's them.

SAD3_EXT_2 = ~z~We got him.

SAD3_EXT_3 = ~z~I knew you'd be back, Ramon...

SAD3_EXT_4 = ~z~you just can't get enough of me.

SAD3_EXT_5 = ~z~Put him in the wagon for me, would you?

SAD3_EXT_6 = ~z~How's the jail?

SAD3_EXT_7 = ~z~Needs to get fixed up...

SAD3_EXT_8 = ~z~since this nice man blew a hole in it.

SAD3_EXT_9 = ~z~Me and the boys will ride him to Saint Denis...

SAD3_EXT_10 = ~z~right away this time.

SAD3_EXT_11 = ~z~Come along, Cortez.

SAD3_EXT_12 = ~z~Sheriff, before you go...

SAD3_EXT_13 = ~z~I'll pay you when I deliver him.

SAD3_EXT_14 = ~z~Plus seventy five dollars.

SAD3_EXT_15 = ~z~Exactly.

SAD3_EXT_16 = ~z~Now, goodbye. Let's go, boys.

SAD3_EXT_17 = ~z~I'll see you soon, amigos.

SAD3_EXT_18 = ~z~Shut up.

SAD3_EXT_19 = ~z~Thanks for this, John.

SAD3_EXT_20 = ~z~Will you send my money to the bank for me?

SAD3_EXT_21 = ~z~Of course.

SAD3_EXT_22 = ~z~I'm supposed to be retired from this.

SAD3_EXT_23 = ~z~This?

SAD3_EXT_24 = ~z~Weren't nothing...

SAD3_EXT_25 = ~z~just a simple arrest.

SAD3_EXT_26 = ~z~Money for old rope.

SAD3_EXT_27 = ~z~If you say so.

SAD3_EXT_28 = ~z~See you around, partner.

SAD3_EXT_LEADIN_1 = ~z~We got him, Sheriff... we got him...

SAD3_IG1_HOUSE_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6:1~Didn't I tell you? It's the barn.

SAD3_IG1_HOUSE_7 = ~z~The bastard's been here for days.

SAD3_IG1_HOUSE_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6:1~Do your worst to him.

SAD3_IG1_HOUSE_9 = ~z~~sl:0.9~You sure he ain't in here?

SAD3_IG1_HOUSE_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2:1~If he was in here, you'd know. Take a look.

SAD3_IG1_HOUSE_11 = ~z~~sl:5.0:1.0:1~Dangit.

SAD3_INT_53 = ~z~also pretty dangerous.

SAD3_INT_54 = ~z~With you it'll be fine, but I wouldn't do it on my own.

SAD3_INT_55 = ~z~I ain't got much choice.

SAD3_INT_56 = ~z~Alright then, come on.
