NATUR_IDLE_2_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~It'd get better if you stopped scratching.~sl:0.8:1.6~Or fine, just ignore me.~sl:0.6~What do I know?

NATUR_IDLE_3_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~It's just for a few days.~sl:0.3~If I let you out again, you'll only run off.

NATUR_IDLE_3_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~It's not perfect, but you need to heal.~sl:0.3~We'll be laughing about this next week.

NATUR_IDLE_3_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~What do you want me to say, you little thief?~sl:0.3:1.35~It wasn't you I saw?

NATUR_IDLE_4_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Where's that acorn?~sl:1.7~You little tinker!

NATUR_IDLE_4_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~How'd you get so clean?~sl:0.2~I saw you in that campfire soot yesterday.

NATUR_IDLE_4_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~You came to see me?~sl:0.3:1.7~You're buttering me up, aren't you?~sl:0.2~Someone's looking for a treat.

NATUR_IDLE_5_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~You did what now?~sl:0.0:3.8~You are too sneaky, I am going to have to watch you.

NATUR_IDLE_5_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Is that right?~sl:1.8:2.5~Well, I'll believe it when I see it,~sl:~thank you very much.

NATUR_IDLE_6_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Well, I wasn't born yesterday.~sl:1.4~Oh, you. You are just like an otter I know.

NATUR_IDLE_6_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~I think we're going to be fast friends.~sl:0.0:3.5~Now, wait... how about I make you your favorite for dinner?

NATUR_IDLE_6_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Oh, please, what nonsense!~sl:0.0:3.1~You'll try anything to get one over on me, won't you?~sl:0.5~Naughty.

NATUR_IDLE_7_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~Okay, okay, stop changing your mind, Harriet.~sl:1.0:2.1~Stop changing your mind.

NATUR_IDLE_7_02 = ~z~~sl:0.5:0.8~What am I doing?~sl:0.9~Just, just... calm down, Harriet. Calm down...

NATUR_IDLE_7_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Yes, yes, that'll work.~sl:0.0:3.5~Don't overthink it. Just... just write it down.~sl:0.5~Yes... write it down.

NATUR_IDLE_8_01 = ~z~~sl:1.0:1.5~That's enough of that...

NATUR_IDLE_8_02 = ~z~~sl:1.0:1.0~Cold!~sl:2.0:2.2~Now... where was I?

NATUR_IDLE_8_03 = ~z~~sl:1.2:1.8~Little luxuries.~sl:2.0:1.0~Anyway...

NATUR_IDLE_9_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~And... yes.~sl:0.5~That should do it.

NATUR_IDLE_9_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Good.~sl:0.7~Now, for some muddling.

NATUR_IDLE_9_03 = ~z~~sl:1.7~Well, let's see if that works.

NATUR_IDLINGMEN_01 = ~z~Come on now, can't hang around all day.

NATUR_IDLINGMEN_02 = ~z~Well? I've met more decisive hummingbirds.

NATUR_IDLINGMEN_03 = ~z~~sl:0.9~I do have quite a lot to do here.

NATUR_IG6_SPRY1_1 = ~z~You've got some nerve! You think that I wouldn't find out?

NATUR_IG6_SPRY2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I've heard what you've been doing, they tell me...~sl:~they tell me, you know?

NATUR_IG6_SPRY2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.4~Disgraceful. You should be ashamed of yourself!

NATUR_IG6_SPRY3_1 = ~z~Oh, I know what you've been up to, word travels fast in the forest.

NATUR_IG6_SPRY3_2 = ~z~Well... I won't stand for it.

NATUR_JB_2SPHI1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I've received terrible news. A new pack has been spotted...~sl:~poachers, hunters, doesn't matter what the law calls them,

NATUR_JB_2SPHI1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~these killers are conquering every living thing they can sell for a dollar.~sl:~I've tried to commune with them, and the nerve they had!

NATUR_JB_2SPHI1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~“We're just trying to make a living, ma'am, this is our livelihood, miss...”.~sl:~Savages! Listen...

NATUR_JB_2SPHI1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~I understand that means can be a struggle to come by...~sl:0.5~but there are ways to earn a living that do not involve bloodshed, or cruelty.

NATUR_JB_2SPHI1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~I think they need to learn that their barbarism costs more than they realize.~sl:0.6~Much more. Don't you?

NATUR_JB_2SPHI2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~I am simply livid.~sl:0.0:3.8~I don't know if they're Macmillan's boys or not, but they're killers for certain,~sl:~a squadron of bloody blisters waiting to be burst.

NATUR_JB_2SPHI2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~These men will not stop cracking away with their guns~sl:~and stinking up the air with their cheap cigarettes.

NATUR_JB_2SPHI2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~“We're not bad fellows, we're just making money for our families.”~sl:~At what cost?

NATUR_JB_2SPHI2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~If you would be so kind... this troupe have camped nearby,~sl:0.0:2.3~and they'll be there long enough for you to pay them a visit.~sl:~One they'll remember, if you catch my meaning.

NATUR_JB_2SPHI2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I am not a violent person, but they deserve what's coming their way.~sl:0.6~Will you please see that they get it?

NATUR_JB_2SPHI5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~They're at it again... they're at it again!~sl:0.0:3.2~Some heavy-browed sadists have been galumphing around the area,~sl:~and decided to set up camp to rest easy

NATUR_JB_2SPHI5_2 = ~z~while they go about their massacres. They think they're entitled to everything.

NATUR_JB_2SPHI5_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~“America is the land of opportunity, free for the taking to those willing to take it...”.~sl:~Just despicable!

NATUR_JB_2SPHI5_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~If anyone deserved to be hunted,~sl:0.0:4.2~I think you'd agree that these fine fellows have earned their place.~sl:~How would you feel about dropping by and giving them a taste of their methods?

NATUR_JB_2SPHI5_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~I will do what I can to protect this land, and the animals that call it home.~sl:~With your help, I'm confident in my success.

NATUR_JB_3SNSS2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Oh, I just received wonderful news from Father.~sl:0.0:3.4~His oldest cat, Theodosia, had a healthy litter last week.~sl:~I'm so happy for her.

NATUR_JB_3SNSS2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Theodosia has always been a hard-headed little pussy,~sl:~but I knew she wanted kittens of her own...

NATUR_JB_3SNSS2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I'm surprised she was willing to settle down, even for a night...~sl:0.4~must have been someone special! Okay, okay.

NATUR_JB_3SNSS2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~It's not my business to pry, and I'm sure you're not here for idle gossip.~sl:~This rumor might be of more interest...

NATUR_JB_3SNSS2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~an unusual animal has been spotted.~sl:0.0:3.7~I can hardly believe what I've heard, but if it's true I'll need a sample.~sl:~It could be vital to our studies.

NATUR_JB_3SPHI3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I've been meaning to tell you... I've made a new friend.~sl:0.0:2.8~A fox, oh, so often a fox.~sl:~I know I'm not the easiest woman to get along with,

NATUR_JB_3SPHI3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.2~but this animal, well... do you know what it's like, to be seen?~sl:~To feel accepted, without reservation, for who you are?

NATUR_JB_3SPHI3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~And now I'm just terrified that they,~sl:~a cabal of skin-hunters, have set up camp nearby.

NATUR_JB_3SPHI3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~They'll wipe out the whole region if they aren't stopped,~sl:0.4~including my Frances...

NATUR_JB_3SPHI3_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~you'll drop in on them, won't you?~sl:0.6~You are very convincing...

NATUR_JB_3SPHI6_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Listen, before I tell you this... don't do anything rash, okay?~sl:0.6~I was tracking this beautiful, curmudgeonly bear the other day,

NATUR_JB_3SPHI6_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~I noted his markings, I heard him complaining, and I kept my distance... but...~sl:1.2~a whole group of hunters came along, and...

NATUR_JB_3SPHI6_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~and they were following me, and...~sl:0.7~I froze. I watched the whole thing from a distance, as they...

NATUR_JB_3SPHI6_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~I... I failed, but you can make things better.~sl:~They have a camp nearby. You'll take care of it, right?

NATUR_JB_3SPHI6_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~I know I can't help that poor bear...~sl:0.5~but you can avenge its death.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Well, I sincerely hope you've stayed~sl:~well away from that neanderthal Gus Macmillan.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Can you imagine if he took such delight~sl:0.0:2.9~in murdering his fellow men, and displaying~sl:~their severed heads on the wall?

NATUR_JB_BSIGH1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~He'd be straight to the noose. Anyhow...~sl:0.2:1.3~I've heard rumors of a magnificent bear~sl:~that's been seen around these parts.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~You'll know it when you see it...~sl:0.5~a fox told me.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~If you could track it down and get me a sample,~sl:0.0:2.9~I'd love to study the physiology in more detail...~sl:0.4~just, please be gentle with it?

NATUR_JB_BSIGH2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Oh, you won't believe what he's done now.~sl:0.4~I went to pick up a package yesterday, expecting a new endowment from Father,

NATUR_JB_BSIGH2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~only to find a stack of dry-aged steaks,~sl:~from Macmillan, with a note saying,

NATUR_JB_BSIGH2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~"Something to keep you going while you're fondling the fauna!".~sl:1.5~Disgusting brute.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Anyway... there have been some sightings in various areas~sl:~of a wolf pack with a very large and impressive leader, by all accounts.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~I'd very much appreciate it if you could get me a sample... to study.~sl:0.6~I will show that man if it's the last thing I do.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~I have to tell you... I spent last night out with a pack of peccaries...~sl:~it was magical. They let me in.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Accepted me as one of them... we laughed... and we cried...~sl:~I-I feel like I'm so close to a breakthrough, but I need more research material.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~I've heard stories of a legendary beaver,~sl:0.0:3.8~very distinctive in appearance and unusual in behavior,~sl:~that I'd love to be able to study... if you can get me a sample.

NATUR_JB_BSIGH3_4 = ~z~We are doing something truly beautiful here, you and me... we truly are.

NATUR_JB_SBESP3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~You know, sometimes I awake naked in the woods far from here,~sl:0.0:2.5~to complete and utter silence...~sl:~eerie for a moment, until I realize that I

NATUR_JB_SBESP3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~and every living being around me are breathing as one.~sl:0.5~I must continue this work. Which is why I need your help

NATUR_JB_SBESP3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~tracking down another sample for me,~sl:0.0:4.6~from a bear, a blonde and ferocious beast that's been wreaking havoc~sl:~in the mountains near Strawberry.

NATUR_JB_SBESP3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~It'll be dangerous, but so valuable to our studies.~sl:0.7~They all are, aren't they?

NATUR_JB_SBIGE3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Listen to this...~sl:2.1:1.3~Do you know what that means?~sl:~"My name is Harriet". Isn't that wonderful?

NATUR_JB_SBIGE3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~To think, all those years I wasted learning French when I could have been out here.~sl:1.3~We must push on with our research.

NATUR_JB_SBIGE3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~So, there's a bison I've been hearing about,~sl:0.0:2.7~a formidable specimen if the rumors are true.~sl:0.6~I'd very much like to study its physiology if you can get me a sample?

NATUR_JB_SBIGE3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Doesn't this make you feel good?~sl:~Hunting humanely in the name of science? It really does.

NATUR_JB_SBISP2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Finally, someone not here to mock me. I hope.~sl:0.5~The arrogance of people.

NATUR_JB_SBISP2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~The blind refusal to entertain the idea that there is something~sl:~outside our meagre understanding, that maybe, just maybe,

NATUR_JB_SBISP2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~our minds exist beyond us in a shared consciousness!~sl:0.6~It's just frustrating. Anyhow...

NATUR_JB_SBISP2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~apparently there's a herd of bison led by a striking red Payta~sl:0.0:3.5~roaming the Little Creek valley, which sounds like a perfect specimen~sl:~to round out my bison studies!

NATUR_JB_SBISP2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~I hear there are some good vantage points over the valley,~sl:~and look for signs of tree rubbing. They love to scratch.

NATUR_JB_SBOGE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~The things people say to me...~sl:0.0:2.1~Not you. I mean, do I smell?~sl:0.4~A-actually, don't answer that. I bathe with sap in the river,

NATUR_JB_SBOGE2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~pick my teeth regularly with reeds and twigs. I'm as clean as nature intended.~sl:0.5~Who decided that a woman needs to cover herself in

NATUR_JB_SBOGE2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~artificial powder and fragrance?~sl:0.7:1.0~It's all such a scam.~sl:0.5~Anyway, we can discuss the commercialization of personal hygiene another time.

NATUR_JB_SBOGE2_4 = ~z~I've been hearing about a rare boar, not of the Gus Macmillan kind...

NATUR_JB_SBOGE2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~B-O-A-R... a striking and powerful animal,~sl:0.6~could you track it and get me a sample?

NATUR_JB_SBOSP3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~There was a young pig from Racine. Whose botanical interests were keen.~sl:~He planted a sock. In a bright window box.

NATUR_JB_SBOSP3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Where it blossomed and sprouted a bean.~sl:2.1:2.1~I don't know why t-that came into my head...~sl:~Oh, yes I do. The boar. I almost forgot.

NATUR_JB_SBOSP3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~A beautiful black and white Icahi piebald that's been spotted~sl:~in the vicinity of MacFarlane's Ranch and Thieves Landing,

NATUR_JB_SBOSP3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~which has attracted the interest of local hunters.~sl:0.5~I was thinking perhaps you could try to beat them to it? I'd love a sample.

NATUR_JB_SBUGE3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~I had a wonderful experience last night...~sl:0.0:4.1~a group of chipmunks, a scurry of chipmunks, I should say...~sl:~sensed I was cold, and came to sleep with me.

NATUR_JB_SBUGE3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Such a gentle and generous act.~sl:0.6:3.0~We cannot abandon this work, it's too important.~sl:0.7~But... I'm short on deer samples.

NATUR_JB_SBUGE3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~There have been sightings of an impressive buck that should make interesting study material,~sl:~if you think you can track it down for me?

NATUR_JB_SBUGE3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~If we keep pushing, and work together...~sl:~there's really no knowing how far this journey will take us.

NATUR_JB_SBUSP2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~I hear Macmillan's murder for hire business continues to grow.~sl:0.0:1.8~I should pay someone to kill him.~sl:0.4~I'm joking, of course.

NATUR_JB_SBUSP2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.7~I would never sink to his level. It's just the greed and arrogance of that man.~sl:~These are sentient beings, with complex emotions!

NATUR_JB_SBUSP2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.7:1.2~Such a struggle sometimes.~sl:0.6:1.7~But I was hoping you'd come by...~sl:~a man was telling me he was in Annesburg recently, and overheard some loggers there

NATUR_JB_SBUSP2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~talking about a very unusual looking deer.~sl:~Sounds like maybe a Shadow Buck. Worth some further investigation at least?

NATUR_JB_SBUSP2_5 = ~z~Together, I know we can do this. We can't give up.

NATUR_JB_SBVSP2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well, the murderers are out in force again.~sl:0.4~There have been rumors in Van Horn about some men coming in to hunt a rare beaver that

NATUR_JB_SBVSP2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Gus Macmillan has put up a bounty for.~sl:~Another pelt that he'll probably just turn into a pair of gloves,

NATUR_JB_SBVSP2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~and sell for an obscene amount of money.~sl:1.2~That man's greed! But, anyway. It does sound like a spectacular creature.

NATUR_JB_SBVSP2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~A Night Beaver. Beautiful, jet black... a perfect specimen for my studies.~sl:0.4~Apparently, these men will be arriving by train into Annesburg.

NATUR_JB_SBVSP2_5 = ~z~Maybe if you follow them, you can get to this poor beaver before they do.

NATUR_JB_SCOGE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Yes, I'm still here. Crazy Harriet. That's what they call me.~sl:~But every pioneer seems crazy, it's the cross we bear.

NATUR_JB_SCOGE2_2 = ~z~It amazes me how many people accept without question a higher power,

NATUR_JB_SCOGE2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~but not the possibility of hidden rhythms within nature that connect us all.~sl:0.9:0.9~I could just scream.~sl:0.6~Well, I can't allow them to get to me. This work is too important.

NATUR_JB_SCOGE2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~To that end, I spotted a cougar the other day,~sl:~one of the most impressive examples I've ever laid eyes on.

NATUR_JB_SCOGE2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Do you think you could track it down and prize a sample,~sl:~humanely of course? I'll show them who's really crazy.

NATUR_JB_SCOSP3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~I know I shouldn't generalize,~sl:0.0:3.8~but the vole is really a rather fickle creature, don't you find?~sl:0.5~Best friend one day, a stranger the next.

NATUR_JB_SCOSP3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~I mean I see it as a sign of intelligence more than anything else... No?~sl:0.6~Anyway, a conversation for another day.

NATUR_JB_SCOSP3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~I just heard some livestock in New Austin were wiped out by a vicious predator~sl:~that sounds to me like it could be a rare Sapa Cougar.

NATUR_JB_SCOSP3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Do you think you could go and check it out for me?~sl:0.5:3.8~If we keep working together like this, we will have a breakthrough.~sl:0.7~I know it.

NATUR_JB_SCYGE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~What a day.~sl:0.4:3.0~I found a coyote I know... or knew, I should say.~sl:0.4~Torso blown wide open and just left there,

NATUR_JB_SCYGE2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~presumably because the pelt was too damaged to be usable.~sl:0.4~The world has lost another beautiful soul, and for what?

NATUR_JB_SCYGE2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Murdered and left in the dirt to rot! Oh, it makes me so angry!~sl:0.8~Anyway, there's another coyote, alive as far as I know.

NATUR_JB_SCYGE2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Muscular and quite unusual in appearance.~sl:~If you could find a way to subdue it and get me a sample,

NATUR_JB_SCYGE2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~I can study it in more detail.~sl:0.6~I'll find a way to convince people to stop all this mindless killing.

NATUR_JB_SCYSP1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~You know, I seem to spend half my time out here trying to~sl:~apologize to my brothers and sisters for the sins of my species.

NATUR_JB_SCYSP1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~What gives us the right to destroy life on a whim,~sl:0.0:2.5~with complete impunity, and where will it end?~sl:~Fifty? A hundred years from now? Ever?

NATUR_JB_SCYSP1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Well, there have been reports of a coyote leading its pack~sl:~on a rampage through the town of Blackwater.

NATUR_JB_SCYSP1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Revenge? Who can say...~sl:~but it sounds as unique as it is ferocious, white with blue eyes.

NATUR_JB_SCYSP1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Do you think you could track it and get me a sample?~sl:0.5~Before it's another head on someone's wall.

NATUR_JB_SELSP3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~I have to tell you something... a coyote came into my camp last night,~sl:0.0:2.4~and what began as something of a standoff...~sl:0.4~ended as something quite magical.

NATUR_JB_SELSP3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~An exchange of emotional gifts.~sl:0.5~It's truly amazing what we can achieve when we think outside ourselves.

NATUR_JB_SELSP3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Anyway, more importantly... or maybe less importantly,~sl:~a legendary white Inahme Elk has been spotted in the Grizzlies north of Colter.

NATUR_JB_SELSP3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Could you go and see if you can track it down and gather a sample?~sl:0.4~Dress warmly, though, I don't want you freezing to death.

NATUR_JB_SFXSP3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Have you ever sang to a fox?~sl:0.0:3.6~Sang while you looked deep into its eyes? It's quite beautiful.~sl:~It's like an invisible barrier melts away,

NATUR_JB_SFXSP3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~and in that moment there is trust. Complete trust.~sl:0.5~Anyway, I've been hearing stories about a fox that been spotted in Saint Denis and Rhodes,

NATUR_JB_SFXSP3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~with very unusual coloring. Something of a local legend.~sl:0.5:3.3~Only comes out at night and in thick fog, apparently.~sl:~Sounds very intelligent,

NATUR_JB_SFXSP3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I'd quite like to study it, if you think you might be able to track it down.~sl:0.7:1.7~I wouldn't sing to this one, though.

NATUR_JB_SIAGE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I thought for a second you were those campers back again...~sl:~horrible men, drinking, cursing, roasting all manner of meat on the fire. Disgusting.

NATUR_JB_SIAGE2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~These creatures are our brothers and sisters...~sl:~it's really no different from cannibalism when you think about it.

NATUR_JB_SIAGE2_3 = ~z~~sl:2.1:1.1~It makes me so angry.~sl:0.5~Anyhow, one thing I heard them talking about was an alligator they'd spotted.

NATUR_JB_SIAGE2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Unlike anything they'd ever seen before in terms of size and markings, apparently.~sl:~I'd be very interested in studying its biology, if you think you could...

NATUR_JB_SIAGE2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~track it down and get a sample?~sl:0.4~If other people only understood what I do.

NATUR_JB_SIASP1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Well, you won't believe what I've~sl:0.0:1.8~just been reading in the newspaper...~sl:0.0:1.6~apparently the new accessory du jour~sl:~for the lady this year is the alligator handbag.

NATUR_JB_SIASP1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Murdering these noble, prehistoric creatures for fashion?~sl:0.4:1.7~Would they wear one made of human skin?~sl:~I highly doubt it.

NATUR_JB_SIASP1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.9:0.7~Anyway...~sl:0.5:3.0~there have been some sightings of a spectacular crocodilian~sl:~near an estate in Saint Denis.

NATUR_JB_SIASP1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~A Banded Gator.~sl:~Beautiful red and white markings, by all accounts.

NATUR_JB_SIASP1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~If you could source me a sample,~sl:0.0:1.5~I'd very much like to study it...~sl:0.0:~Before some brute turns it into a wallet, or pair of slippers.

NATUR_JB_SIEGE1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Sorry if I'm a little flustered...~sl:0.0:1.9~I just received a letter from my sister...~sl:~saying that I'm an embarrassment to the Davenport name...

NATUR_JB_SIEGE1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~that I should be getting married and starting a family.~sl:~She's the embarrassment, not me! I'm on a voyage of discovery.

NATUR_JB_SIEGE1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Anyway, talking of which... some travelers were telling me about an elk,~sl:~that's become quite legendary by all accounts.

NATUR_JB_SIEGE1_4 = ~z~Unique in appearance and size.

NATUR_JB_SIEGE1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~If you could track it down and source me a sample,~sl:0.0:2.6~it sounds like a very interesting animal to study.~sl:0.4~Just please... treat it with kindness.

NATUR_JB_SIFGE1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~I just can't believe how many people Gus Macmillan has working for him now.~sl:~And I very much hope that you're not one of them.

NATUR_JB_SIFGE1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~It's nothing more than a mass murder for hire scheme,~sl:0.0:1.9~lining his pockets with blood money.~sl:~He should be hanged and quartered!

NATUR_JB_SIFGE1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Anyway, I can't allow myself to get too worked up by that boor.~sl:~So... in better news, I spotted a spectacular fox the other day,

NATUR_JB_SIFGE1_4 = ~z~one of the most striking I've ever seen.

NATUR_JB_SIFGE1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I'm very keen to find out more about its genetics,~sl:0.0:1.2~if you can bring me a sample.~sl:0.5~Just... please don't hurt it.

NATUR_JB_SIMSP2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~So, I ran into Gus Macmillan again.~sl:0.0:2.5~How that man delights in tormenting me.~sl:~Now he has his sights on a new trophy,

NATUR_JB_SIMSP2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~a rare moose that he wants to slaughter and turn into slippers~sl:~or belts or whatever it is he does to make his blood money.

NATUR_JB_SIMSP2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Oh, he makes me sick!~sl:1.5:3.7~Anyway, this moose is apparently a spectacular specimen.~sl:~Cream with red antlers.

NATUR_JB_SIMSP2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~I was hoping maybe you could try get to it before Macmillan's hunters do and...~sl:0.4~gather some information for me?

NATUR_JB_SIMSP2_5 = ~z~We should be learning from these animals... not destroying them.

NATUR_JB_SIPGE1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I was starting to worry that Gus Macmillan~sl:0.0:2.7~might have lured you into his vile profiteering,~sl:~a man whom, I recently heard,

NATUR_JB_SIPGE1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~once slaughtered twenty elephants in Africa~sl:0.0:1.4~just because he lost a drunken bet.~sl:0.5~One day this will all come back to him!

NATUR_JB_SIPGE1_3 = ~z~So... I've been hearing about a panther, that no doubt he's got his eyes on, too.

NATUR_JB_SIPGE1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~A majestic creature... if the reports are to be believed.~sl:~I'd be interested to do some genetic analysis on such a distinctive example,

NATUR_JB_SIPGE1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~if you could track it down and get me a sample?~sl:0.5~I will pay you for your efforts, of course.

NATUR_JB_SIRGE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Well, I should have seen it coming.~sl:0.0:2.1~Mother's now threatening to cancel my endowment,~sl:~solely because I refused to come home for Thanksgiving this year.

NATUR_JB_SIRGE2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~I know she just wants to sit me next to that silly young doctor again.~sl:0.4~When will they understand the impact of what I'm doing out here?

NATUR_JB_SIRGE2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.7:1.0~It makes me so mad!~sl:0.6:4.2~Sorry, I shouldn't vent. It's just you're one of the few who understands.~sl:~And this is good timing...

NATUR_JB_SIRGE2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I just heard about a ram that's been spotted,~sl:~a quite rare example if the rumors are true.

NATUR_JB_SIRGE2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Do you think you could try to track it and get me a sample?~sl:0.4~The work must go on.

NATUR_JB_SIRSP1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Have you been hearing about this ram in New Austin?~sl:0.4~Apparently, all number of people are out trying to track it and kill the poor thing...

NATUR_JB_SIRSP1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~just because it showed some aggression.~sl:0.4:1.5~It's probably just defending itself.~sl:0.5~And what is more aggressive than a man with a gun?

NATUR_JB_SIRSP1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Anyway, it sounds like a truly spectacular animal.~sl:~A Rutile Horn. Jet black, impressive size, and very intelligent.

NATUR_JB_SIRSP1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Rumors is, it's been luring ovines away from other herds,~sl:~which is very unusual.

NATUR_JB_SIRSP1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~It was spotted passing north of Venter's Place.~sl:~I'd love to study it, if you can get me a sample?

NATUR_JB_SMOGE3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Oh, before I forget...~sl:0.0:3.6~I've been consuming a woodpecker diet for the past couple of days...~sl:~and just made a delicious acorn and pine nut goulash.

NATUR_JB_SMOGE3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.6~If you ever want the recipe. It's so important to eat as they do.~sl:0.5:1.4~Anyhow, onto business.~sl:0.4~A moose sighting, sounds like a rare one,

NATUR_JB_SMOGE3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~certainly an impressive size.~sl:~Could you see if you can track it down and get a sample before it ends up on some hunter's wall?

NATUR_JB_SMOGE3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~We're becoming quite the team, you and me.~sl:0.5~Quite the team.

NATUR_JB_SNSS1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Have you felt the air recently?~sl:~Not its wind, but its energy. The air itself.

NATUR_JB_SNSS1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~All of life is caught up within it,~sl:0.0:3.2~a potent and ever-expanding web all around us...~sl:~you can reach out and touch it.

NATUR_JB_SNSS1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~What? Don't you laugh!~sl:0.0:2.3~This world around us, everything is connected.~sl:0.5~You must accept that...

NATUR_JB_SNSS1_4 = ~z~Perhaps this rare and beautiful animal will help convince you.

NATUR_JB_SNSS1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Find it, commune with it, and get me a sample.~sl:0.0:1.1~I need to know more.~sl:0.4:1.4~You need to know more, too.

NATUR_JB_SNSS2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Listen to this. Simply unbelievable. I was collecting firewood,~sl:~careful not to dislodge anyone from their homes,

NATUR_JB_SNSS2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~when I turn and am greeted by some man,~sl:~bedecked in a mass of animal skins, who thinks fit to lecture me.

NATUR_JB_SNSS2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~“You know this here's a habitat, ma'am. You could be upsetting the animals.”~sl:~The nerve! Him telling me my business...

NATUR_JB_SNSS2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.7~But anyway, that 'expert naturalist' also said he was on the lookout~sl:~for some rare creature that had migrated recently.

NATUR_JB_SNSS2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Why don't you see if you could find it first?~sl:0.5~I don't trust that man's intentions for a second.

NATUR_JB_SPASP2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~You know...~sl:0.0:4.2~I think back to when we first met, and I still can't get over the image of~sl:~Macmillan walking down those stairs, with that

NATUR_JB_SPASP2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~poor panther slung over his shoulder.~sl:0.4~How smug and proud he looked, parading a corpse like a badge of honor...

NATUR_JB_SPASP2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Who does that? It's so infuriating.~sl:0.5:5.7~Anyway... I was reminded of this by reports of another panther active around Braithwaite manor.~sl:~An Iwakta.

NATUR_JB_SPASP2_4 = ~z~Rare markings and majestic in stature, but very aggressive, I hear.

NATUR_JB_SPASP2_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Could you try to locate it and get me a sample~sl:~before someone inevitably guns it down?

NATUR_JB_SPHI1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~You know, this is profound work we're doing.~sl:0.4~This project may seem insignificant, but in time

NATUR_JB_SPHI1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~we'll push these greedy killers to the margins,~sl:0.0:3.3~and they'll hang portraits of us on every wall in Congress.~sl:0.4~Mark those words.

NATUR_JB_SPHI1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Until that day, however...~sl:~those killers have set up camp nearby and are having their way with the local population.

NATUR_JB_SPHI1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~You've got to take care of this.~sl:0.4~Don't worry, they'll never suspect a thing.

NATUR_JB_SPHI1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Men like that... oh, I could just wring their necks!~sl:0.5:1.8~But I'll leave that to you instead.~sl:0.7~Thank you.

NATUR_JB_SPHI4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~We're in a war here.~sl:0.4~Gus Macmillan and his philistine horde are one spearpoint in an army of invaders

NATUR_JB_SPHI4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~that want to rip this land up by its roots and plaster the ruins~sl:~with cheap houses and totems of their barbary. That can't happen.

NATUR_JB_SPHI4_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~A regiment of Macmillan's horde have settled in the area~sl:0.0:3.2~and are claiming the local wildlife as their prize.~sl:0.4~I need you to strike back.

NATUR_JB_SPHI4_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~I need you to remind Gus and his dead-eyed brutes~sl:~what it feels like to be on the receiving end.

NATUR_JB_SPHI4_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Just be careful what gets caught in the crossfire...~sl:0.6~this war is already too costly.

NATUR_JB_SPHI7_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~You don't eat meat, do you?~sl:0.6~Just the other day, I had a fascinating interaction with a cougar,

NATUR_JB_SPHI7_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~who communicated to me in no uncertain terms~sl:~that she wished she could just live off fruits and seeds.
