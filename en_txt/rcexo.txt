RCEXO_RCS4_14 = ~z~You're a wonderful fellow, James.

RCEXO_RCS4_15 = ~z~A man of a rare distinction.

RCEXO_RCS4_16 = ~z~Herculean labors performed almost effortlessly...

RCEXO_RCS4_17 = ~z~in the pursuit of art.

RCEXO_RCS4_18 = ~z~The Contessa, well, she's a terrible hag, but...

RCEXO_RCS4_19 = ~z~she'll be...

RCEXO_RCS4_20 = ~z~Well then... did you get those eggs?

RCEXO_RCS4_21 = ~z~You're a wonderful fellow, Tacitus.

RCEXO_RCS4_22 = ~z~A man of a rare distinction.

RCEXO_RCS4_29 = ~z~What do you think of this hat?

RCEXO_RCS4_30 = ~z~Very...

RCEXO_RCS4_31 = ~z~exotic.

RCEXO_RCS4_32 = ~z~I made it for you.

RCEXO_RCS4_33 = ~z~For me?

RCEXO_RCS4_34 = ~z~I'm just... it's...

RCEXO_RCS4_35 = ~z~it'd be wasted on me, Algernon.

RCEXO_RCS4_36 = ~z~It's too fine, for a man of my... coarseness.

RCEXO_RCS4_37 = ~z~At least try it on.

RCEXO_RCS4_38 = ~z~No...

RCEXO_RCS4_46 = ~z~it's all wrong.

RCEXO_RCS4_47 = ~z~I went forte and I should've gone molto adagio.

RCEXO_RCS4_48 = ~z~Here's your money for the eggs and the flowers.

RCEXO_RCS4_49 = ~z~You got anything else?

RCEXO_RCS4_50 = ~z~But I've imposed too much already...

RCEXO_RCS4_51 = ~z~and I'm ashamed of the millinery.

RCEXO_RCS4_52 = ~z~You pay well...

RCEXO_RCS4_53 = ~z~it's easy enough work.

RCEXO_RCS4_54 = ~z~I do need some more orchids...

RCEXO_RCS4_55 = ~z~fairly rare ones, quite a few.

RCEXO_RCS4_56 = ~z~It's for a cabinet I'm making for a...

RCEXO_RCS4_57 = ~z~wonderfully spoilt little girl on Fifth Avenue.

RCEXO_RCS4_58 = ~z~I...

RCEXO_RCS4_59 = ~z~thought you hated New Yorkers?

RCEXO_RCS4_60 = ~z~I do... I'm just so dreadfully weak willed.

RCEXO_RCS4_61 = ~z~It's not the money...

RCEXO_RCS4_62 = ~z~it's the chance to make these things.

RCEXO_RCS4_63 = ~z~Oh, I wanted to say no James, I really did...

RCEXO_RCS4_64 = ~z~but somehow...

RCEXO_RCS4_65 = ~z~I never can.

RCEXO_RCS4_66 = ~z~I'll see what I can do.

RCEXO_RCS4_67 = ~z~Oh, and James...

RCEXO_RCS4_68 = ~z~I'll make you something.

RCEXO_RCS4_69 = ~z~I do... I'm just so dreadfully weak willed.

RCEXO_RCS4_75 = ~z~Oh, and Tacitus...

RCEXO_RCS4_76 = ~z~I'll make you something.

RCEXO_RCS4_77 = ~z~Honestly, I'm fine.

RCEXO_RCS4_78 = ~z~Oh yes.

RCEXO_RCS4_79 = ~z~I hope so.

RCEXO_RCS4_80 = ~z~Well...

RCEXO_RCS4_81 = ~z~very exotic.

RCEXO_RCS4_82 = ~z~For me?

RCEXO_RCS4_83 = ~z~I'm just a...

RCEXO_RCS4_84 = ~z~it's...

RCEXO_RCS4_85 = ~z~it would be wasted on me, Algernon.

RCEXO_RCS4_86 = ~z~It's too fine for a...

RCEXO_RCS4_88 = ~z~No.

RCEXO_RCS4_89 = ~z~Okay.

RCEXO_RCS4_90 = ~z~Okay.

RCEXO_RCS4_91 = ~z~Here you go.

RCEXO_RCS4_92 = ~z~Yeah...

RCEXO_RCS4_93 = ~z~it's not exactly me.

RCEXO_RCS4_94 = ~z~You got anything else?

RCEXO_RCS4_95 = ~z~You pay well...

RCEXO_RCS4_96 = ~z~and it's easy enough work.

RCEXO_RCS4_97 = ~z~I...

RCEXO_RCS4_98 = ~z~thought you hated New Yorkers?

RCEXO_RSC1_2 = ~z~this is extremely delicate.

RCEXO_RSC1_3 = ~z~There...

RCEXO_RSC1_4 = ~z~wonderful.

RCEXO_RSC1_5 = ~z~May I help you?

RCEXO_RSC1_14 = ~z~How can I help you?

RCEXO_RSC1_15 = ~z~May I interest you in a hat, perhaps?

RCEXO_RSC1_16 = ~z~How about a nymph?

RCEXO_RSC1_17 = ~z~I import them from Brussels.

RCEXO_RSC1_18 = ~z~The idiots in this town all want Italian nymphs...

RCEXO_RSC1_19 = ~z~but the Italians make the coarsest of marble.

RCEXO_RSC1_20 = ~z~I mean, quite frankly, the baroque is an abomination.

RCEXO_RSC1_21 = ~z~Belgium...

RCEXO_RSC1_22 = ~z~now that is a land for the connoisseur.

RCEXO_RSC1_23 = ~z~Yeah, as I always say.

RCEXO_RSC1_24 = ~z~But you know, I'm not really a nymph kind of man.

RCEXO_RSC1_25 = ~z~Oh, of course, too ephemeral...

RCEXO_RSC1_26 = ~z~you want something more tangible...

RCEXO_RSC1_27 = ~z~more gothic.

RCEXO_RSC1_28 = ~z~I also make corsets. Would you like a corset?

RCEXO_RSC1_29 = ~z~I always wear one.

RCEXO_RSC1_30 = ~z~No, I don't think so.

RCEXO_RSC1_31 = ~z~I ride a lot of horses.

RCEXO_RSC1_32 = ~z~I'm afraid the whale bone might stick in.

RCEXO_RSC1_33 = ~z~Hm, well...

RCEXO_RSC1_34 = ~z~a cup of tea?

RCEXO_RSC1_35 = ~z~Sure.

RCEXO_RSC1_36 = ~z~Now what is it you do, Mr. Milton?

RCEXO_RSC1_37 = ~z~Are you a gentleman of leisure, an aesthete...

RCEXO_RSC1_38 = ~z~an artist?

RCEXO_RSC1_39 = ~z~I suppose I'm kind of an adventurer.

RCEXO_RSC1_40 = ~z~And what is it you do, Mr. Kilgore?

RCEXO_RSC1_41 = ~z~Are you a gentleman of leisure, an aesthete...

RCEXO_RSC1_42 = ~z~an artist?

RCEXO_RSC1_43 = ~z~Yes, of course you are.

RCEXO_RSC1_44 = ~z~Here, be careful with the china, sir...

RCEXO_RSC1_45 = ~z~it is French.

RCEXO_RSC1_46 = ~z~Not Belgian?

RCEXO_RSC1_47 = ~z~Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

RCEXO_RSC1_48 = ~z~they are philistines in that area...

RCEXO_RSC1_49 = ~z~not to be trusted.

RCEXO_RSC1_50 = ~z~Youth, eternally preserved in marble is more their specialty.

RCEXO_RSC1_51 = ~z~I fear china will always elude them.

RCEXO_RSC1_52 = ~z~Now, why are you here exactly?

RCEXO_RSC1_53 = ~z~I don't know.

RCEXO_RSC1_54 = ~z~You're an adventurer...

RCEXO_RSC1_55 = ~z~a wanderer, a lost soul cast out from heaven.

RCEXO_RSC1_56 = ~z~Sure.

RCEXO_RSC1_57 = ~z~Well, I do pay exceptionally well...

RCEXO_RSC1_58 = ~z~for certain objects needed for my art.

RCEXO_RSC1_59 = ~z~You do?

RCEXO_RSC1_60 = ~z~I do...

RCEXO_RSC1_61 = ~z~exceptionally well.

RCEXO_RSC1_62 = ~z~Well...

RCEXO_RSC1_63 = ~z~what do you need?

RCEXO_RSC1_64 = ~z~Let's see...

RCEXO_RSC1_65 = ~z~right now I have a couple of commissions.

RCEXO_RSC1_66 = ~z~I need at least fifteen egret plumes...

RCEXO_RSC1_67 = ~z~good ones, obviously.

RCEXO_RSC1_68 = ~z~Also need...

RCEXO_RSC1_69 = ~z~fifteen assorted orchids.

RCEXO_RSC1_70 = ~z~Here's a list.

RCEXO_RSC1_71 = ~z~Okay...

RCEXO_RSC1_72 = ~z~see what I can do.

RCEXO_RSC1_73 = ~z~Thanks for the tea.

RCEXO_RSC1_74 = ~z~Thank you, Mr. Milton...

RCEXO_RSC1_75 = ~z~Thank you, Tacitus...

RCEXO_RSC1_76 = ~z~it'll be very worth your while.

RCEXO_RSC1_77 = ~z~Hey.

RCEXO_RSC1_78 = ~z~Well, I...

RCEXO_RSC1_79 = ~z~I don't know.

RCEXO_RSC1_80 = ~z~I met you, remember?

RCEXO_RSC1_81 = ~z~At that party.

RCEXO_RSC1_82 = ~z~Tacitus Kilgore.

RCEXO_RSC1_83 = ~z~Oh, yes, yeah... as I always say.

RCEXO_RSC1_84 = ~z~But you know, I'm not really a nymph kind of man.

RCEXO_RSC1_85 = ~z~Uhh, no... I don't think so.

RCEXO_RSC1_86 = ~z~I ride a lot of horses...

RCEXO_RSC1_87 = ~z~the whale bone might stick in.

RCEXO_RSC1_88 = ~z~Sure.

RCEXO_RSC1_89 = ~z~I suppose I'm...

RCEXO_RSC1_90 = ~z~kind of an adventurer.

RCEXO_RSC1_91 = ~z~Not Belgian?

RCEXO_RSC1_92 = ~z~I don't know.

RCEXO_RSC1_93 = ~z~Sure.

RCEXO_RSC1_94 = ~z~You do?

RCEXO_RSC1_95 = ~z~Well...

RCEXO_RSC1_96 = ~z~what do you need?

RCEXO_RSC1_97 = ~z~Okay...

RCEXO_RSC1_98 = ~z~I'll see what I can do.

RCEXO_RSC1_99 = ~z~Thanks for the tea.

RCEXO_RSC1_LIG_1 = ~z~One moment please... this is extremely delicate.

RCEXO_RSC1_LI_1 = ~z~There... wonderful.

RCEXO_RSC2_1 = ~z~Good day, sir.

RCEXO_RSC2_2 = ~z~Oh... Mr. Milton.

RCEXO_RSC2_3 = ~z~Mr. Kilgore.

RCEXO_RSC2_6 = ~z~Yes, can I help you?

RCEXO_RSC2_7 = ~z~I'm an old friend of Tacitus Kilgore.

RCEXO_RSC2_8 = ~z~You used to pay him to go find some items for you.

RCEXO_RSC2_9 = ~z~He's moved on now I'm afraid.

RCEXO_RSC2_10 = ~z~Tacitus...

RCEXO_RSC2_11 = ~z~how can I forget?

RCEXO_RSC2_12 = ~z~Well, better seven years late than never I suppose.

RCEXO_RSC2_13 = ~z~Jim Milton.

RCEXO_RSC2_14 = ~z~Charmed.

RCEXO_RSC2_15 = ~z~I got the plumes and the orchids that you asked for.

RCEXO_RSC2_16 = ~z~You did?

RCEXO_RSC2_17 = ~z~The Duchess of Sorrento will be most happy with you.

RCEXO_RSC2_18 = ~z~She's an old friend, the Duchess.

RCEXO_RSC2_19 = ~z~Gone to seed a little now, but in her youth...

RCEXO_RSC2_20 = ~z~oh, she was the most beautiful woman in all of Italy.

RCEXO_RSC2_21 = ~z~A Neapolitan pearl, and even I would have...

RCEXO_RSC2_22 = ~z~Oh...

RCEXO_RSC2_23 = ~z~bellissima.

RCEXO_RSC2_24 = ~z~Quite astonishing.

RCEXO_RSC2_25 = ~z~You're good... oh, you're very good.

RCEXO_RSC2_26 = ~z~Algernon, I whispered to myself...

RCEXO_RSC2_27 = ~z~I said this man has the eye of an artist.

RCEXO_RSC2_28 = ~z~No... he's better than an artist...

RCEXO_RSC2_29 = ~z~he's a man of taste...

RCEXO_RSC2_30 = ~z~a connoisseur, like you.

RCEXO_RSC2_31 = ~z~That's what I murmured to myself...

RCEXO_RSC2_32 = ~z~and I wasn't wrong.

RCEXO_RSC2_33 = ~z~No, sir, I was quite right.

RCEXO_RSC2_34 = ~z~Marvelous...

RCEXO_RSC2_35 = ~z~How much do I get?

RCEXO_RSC2_36 = ~z~Well, ah, I don't, well...

RCEXO_RSC2_37 = ~z~at least a hundred dollars.

RCEXO_RSC2_38 = ~z~This should set you right.

RCEXO_RSC2_39 = ~z~I'm sorry, it's cash, I prefer something less vulgar, but...

RCEXO_RSC2_40 = ~z~such is life.

RCEXO_RSC2_41 = ~z~I'm fine with cash.

RCEXO_RSC2_42 = ~z~Anything else you need?

RCEXO_RSC2_43 = ~z~Me, no, I'm fine.

RCEXO_RSC2_44 = ~z~There is one thing...

RCEXO_RSC2_45 = ~z~more orchids.

RCEXO_RSC2_46 = ~z~Quite a particular list...

RCEXO_RSC2_47 = ~z~but once again I will make it worth your troubles.

RCEXO_RSC2_48 = ~z~Okay.

RCEXO_RSC2_49 = ~z~It's a little something I'm making for the Baroness Von Buchwald.

RCEXO_RSC2_50 = ~z~You know how she is?

RCEXO_RSC2_51 = ~z~Very demanding.

RCEXO_RSC2_52 = ~z~Dreadfully so...

RCEXO_RSC2_53 = ~z~the best ones, they always are.

RCEXO_RSC2_54 = ~z~I got you the plumes and the orchids that you asked for.

RCEXO_RSC2_55 = ~z~How much do I get?

RCEXO_RSC2_56 = ~z~I'm fine with cash.

RCEXO_RSC2_57 = ~z~Anything else you need?

RCEXO_RSC2_58 = ~z~Okay.

RCEXO_RSC2_59 = ~z~Oh, very demanding.

RCEXO_RSC2_LIA_1 = ~z~Good day, sir... oh, Mr. Kilgore...

RCEXO_RSC3_1 = ~z~Yes, can I help you?

RCEXO_RSC3_2 = ~z~I'm an old friend of Tacitus Kilgore...

RCEXO_RSC3_3 = ~z~you used to pay him to go find some items for ya.

RCEXO_RSC3_4 = ~z~He's moved on now I'm afraid.

RCEXO_RSC3_5 = ~z~Tacitus...

RCEXO_RSC3_6 = ~z~how can I forget?

RCEXO_RSC3_7 = ~z~Well, better seven years late than never I suppose.

RCEXO_RSC3_8 = ~z~Jim Milton.

RCEXO_RSC3_9 = ~z~Charmed.

RCEXO_RSC3_10 = ~z~Thank God you came, James...

RCEXO_RSC3_11 = ~z~I was panicking...

RCEXO_RSC3_12 = ~z~Thank God you came, Tacitus...

RCEXO_RSC3_13 = ~z~I was panicking...

RCEXO_RSC3_14 = ~z~I cannot believe the pressure this woman puts me under.

RCEXO_RSC3_15 = ~z~Which woman?

RCEXO_RSC3_16 = ~z~The Baroness, of course.

RCEXO_RSC3_17 = ~z~She writes the most dreadful missives from Baden Baden.

RCEXO_RSC3_18 = ~z~Still, now I will finish her creation.

RCEXO_RSC3_19 = ~z~Oh, my Lord...

RCEXO_RSC3_20 = ~z~and after that...

RCEXO_RSC3_21 = ~z~it's never ending.

RCEXO_RSC3_22 = ~z~If you keep paying...

RCEXO_RSC3_23 = ~z~I can keep looking.

RCEXO_RSC3_24 = ~z~I don't like to impose.

RCEXO_RSC3_25 = ~z~Oh, keep paying me and it's not an imposition.

RCEXO_RSC3_26 = ~z~Well...

RCEXO_RSC3_27 = ~z~here's the money for the orchids...

RCEXO_RSC3_28 = ~z~for that ghastly Baroness...

RCEXO_RSC3_29 = ~z~and next I think we'll work on this.

RCEXO_RSC3_30 = ~z~It's a displayer cabinet of curios...

RCEXO_RSC3_31 = ~z~for the Contessa Di Bellagio's new palazzo on Lake Garda.

RCEXO_RSC3_32 = ~z~She's asked me to summer with her there next year...

RCEXO_RSC3_33 = ~z~but, well...

RCEXO_RSC3_34 = ~z~I find the whole thing a little gaudy.

RCEXO_RSC3_35 = ~z~Italy is just so over run with Americans just now...

RCEXO_RSC3_36 = ~z~don't you find?

RCEXO_RSC3_37 = ~z~Yeah, it's a real problem.

RCEXO_RSC3_38 = ~z~And it's the worst kind of Americans...

RCEXO_RSC3_39 = ~z~financiers, New Yorkers...

RCEXO_RSC3_40 = ~z~they're just such vulgarians.

RCEXO_RSC3_41 = ~z~And, what do you need?

RCEXO_RSC3_42 = ~z~The silly old thing has a penchant for lizards.

RCEXO_RSC3_43 = ~z~So, I'm making her a series of centerpieces...

RCEXO_RSC3_44 = ~z~focused on...

RCEXO_RSC3_45 = ~z~alligator eggs and orchids.

RCEXO_RSC3_46 = ~z~It's about duality.

RCEXO_RSC3_47 = ~z~I'm all about duality.

RCEXO_RSC3_48 = ~z~Here...

RCEXO_RSC3_49 = ~z~and remember, James.

RCEXO_RSC3_50 = ~z~Take your time and bring me nothing...

RCEXO_RSC3_51 = ~z~nothing but the best.

RCEXO_RSC3_52 = ~z~Ah, well.

RCEXO_RSC3_53 = ~z~Here...

RCEXO_RSC3_54 = ~z~and remember, Tacitus.

RCEXO_RSC3_55 = ~z~Take your time and bring me nothing...

RCEXO_RSC3_56 = ~z~nothing but the best.

RCEXO_RSC3_57 = ~z~I'll try.

RCEXO_RSC3_58 = ~z~Which woman?

RCEXO_RSC3_59 = ~z~If you keep paying...

RCEXO_RSC3_60 = ~z~I'll keep looking.

RCEXO_RSC3_61 = ~z~Keep paying me and it's not an imposition.

RCEXO_RSC3_62 = ~z~Yeah, it's a real problem.

RCEXO_RSC3_63 = ~z~What is it that you need?

RCEXO_RSC3_64 = ~z~I'm all about duality.

RCEXO_RSC3_65 = ~z~I'll try.

RCEXO_RSC5_1 = ~z~It's the Contessa.

RCEXO_RSC5_2 = ~z~She's insatiable...

RCEXO_RSC5_3 = ~z~insatiable!

RCEXO_RSC5_4 = ~z~Thank God you're here...

RCEXO_RSC5_5 = ~z~thank you, God.

RCEXO_RSC5_6 = ~z~I've been eating for days.

RCEXO_RSC5_7 = ~z~I've gained...

RCEXO_RSC5_8 = ~z~so much weight.

RCEXO_RSC5_9 = ~z~It's the worry, James, it's...

RCEXO_RSC5_10 = ~z~killing me.

RCEXO_RSC5_11 = ~z~Calm down, Algernon.

RCEXO_RSC5_12 = ~z~This is calm.

RCEXO_RSC5_13 = ~z~so much weight.

RCEXO_RSC5_14 = ~z~It's the worry, Tacitus, it's...

RCEXO_RSC5_15 = ~z~killing me.

RCEXO_RSC5_16 = ~z~This is calm.

RCEXO_RSC5_17 = ~z~You should've seen me yesterday...

RCEXO_RSC5_18 = ~z~I nearly ate the cat.

RCEXO_RSC5_19 = ~z~She says such cruel things.

RCEXO_RSC5_20 = ~z~Yes, can I help you?

RCEXO_RSC5_21 = ~z~I'm an old friend of Tacitus Kilgore.

RCEXO_RSC5_22 = ~z~You used to pay him to go find some items for ya.

RCEXO_RSC5_23 = ~z~He's moved on now I'm afraid.

RCEXO_RSC5_24 = ~z~Tacitus, how can I forget?

RCEXO_RSC5_25 = ~z~Well, better seven years late than never I suppose.

RCEXO_RSC5_26 = ~z~Jim Milton.

RCEXO_RSC5_27 = ~z~Charmed.

RCEXO_RSC5_28 = ~z~Well...

RCEXO_RSC5_29 = ~z~I got the things for the girl in New York.

RCEXO_RSC5_30 = ~z~That strumpet, I don't care about her...

RCEXO_RSC5_31 = ~z~she's trade, she's common...

RCEXO_RSC5_32 = ~z~her father lends money, it's so vulgar.

RCEXO_RSC5_33 = ~z~Oh, damn her.

RCEXO_RSC5_34 = ~z~It's the aristocracy...

RCEXO_RSC5_35 = ~z~it's the old families...

RCEXO_RSC5_36 = ~z~it's the last of the old guard.
