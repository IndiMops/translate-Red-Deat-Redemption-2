CHRC3_BDYN_1 = ~z~You got some explosives?

CHRC3_BDYN_2 = ~z~Sure do.

CHRC3_BILLWAIT_01 = ~z~Let's get going, Morgan.

CHRC3_BILLWAIT_02 = ~z~Come on, or we'll miss it.

CHRC3_BILLWAIT_03 = ~z~What's the hold-up here?

CHRC3_BRIDEOFF_1 = ~z~I'll see you back at camp.

CHRC3_BSTND_1 = ~z~Stand aside.

CHRC3_C1_1 = ~z~Let's cut up through the creek.

CHRC3_CH1_1 = ~z~It ain't stopping! See if you can ride alongside and jump onto it!

CHRC3_CH2_1 = ~z~Hold them horses! Slow it down!

CHRC3_CLIFFALT_1 = ~z~Oh shit!

CHRC3_CLIFF_1 = ~z~Oh shit...

CHRC3_DAWD_1 = ~z~What you doing, Morgan? Get over here.

CHRC3_DYNCHAT_1 = ~z~Don't start giving me more crap about that Cornwall train, alright?

CHRC3_DYNCHAT_2 = ~z~I wouldn't dream of it.

CHRC3_DYNCHAT_3 = ~z~Let's not forget you hooked up the wires, Morgan.

CHRC3_DYNCHAT_4 = ~z~How do we know you didn't mess it up? But entirely blameless, of course.

CHRC3_EXPLD_1 = ~z~Whoa! That should do it.

CHRC3_FLEEING_1 = ~z~Stop the damn coach, now!

CHRC3_IG1_ACTA_1 = ~z~Alright, so the stage should be coming from over there.

CHRC3_IG1_ACTA_2 = ~z~What you want me to do?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_1 = ~z~Just act dumb and silly and get the thing to stop... you know, like you do.

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_2 = ~z~And what you mean by that?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_3 = ~z~Oh come on, don't get all precious and stuck up on me now.

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_4 = ~z~I don't like your manners, Mr. Williamson... in fact I think you're an obnoxious idiot.

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_5 = ~z~What'd you say to me?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_6 = ~z~I didn't say enough to you, you useless half man...

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_7 = ~z~Half man? Half man, what does that even mean?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_8 = ~z~Will you two stop arguing?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTB_9 = ~z~He started it.

CHRC3_IG1_ACTC_1 = ~z~Here's the goddamn stage coach!

CHRC3_IG1_ACTC_2 = ~z~Are we doing this?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTC_3 = ~z~Yes... come on, both of you, follow me!

CHRC3_IG1_ACTC_4 = ~z~What's the plan?

CHRC3_IG1_ACTC_5 = ~z~There's been a change of plan!

CHRC3_IG1_ACTD_1 = ~z~Yes, you act dumb and get them to stop.

CHRC3_INT_1 = ~z~Prepping for a robbery.

CHRC3_INT_2 = ~z~I've had a good run of luck recently...

CHRC3_INT_3 = ~z~Okay.

CHRC3_INT_4 = ~z~Robbed a house up in Roanoke Ridge...

CHRC3_INT_5 = ~z~Robbed a couple of drunken soldiers out near the swamps.

CHRC3_INT_6 = ~z~And what're you about to do?

CHRC3_INT_7 = ~z~A stage.

CHRC3_INT_8 = ~z~Well...

CHRC3_INT_9 = ~z~good luck.

CHRC3_INT_10 = ~z~You wanna come with me?

CHRC3_INT_11 = ~z~Now, I was gonna ask Sean...

CHRC3_INT_12 = ~z~but he's too much of a hot head.

CHRC3_INT_13 = ~z~What's the opportunity?

CHRC3_INT_14 = ~z~A bank stage...

CHRC3_INT_15 = ~z~and without much security.

CHRC3_INT_16 = ~z~This feller was telling me about it couple nights ago when we was drinking.

CHRC3_INT_17 = ~z~It's gonna be coming right through...

CHRC3_INT_18 = ~z~and the bank reckons the cost of security ain't worth the risk.

CHRC3_INT_19 = ~z~Now, there'll be a couple guys, but nothing too serious...

CHRC3_INT_20 = ~z~and lots of money...

CHRC3_INT_21 = ~z~easy money.

CHRC3_INT_22 = ~z~Oh, that's always the dream of every thief...

CHRC3_INT_23 = ~z~easy money.

CHRC3_INT_24 = ~z~Well like I was saying...

CHRC3_INT_25 = ~z~my luck is in now, Arthur.

CHRC3_INT_26 = ~z~Well then...

CHRC3_INT_27 = ~z~why not?

CHRC3_INT_28 = ~z~Who're you taking?

CHRC3_INT_29 = ~z~I think we need a girl.

CHRC3_INT_30 = ~z~See, I got a plan in mind...

CHRC3_INT_31 = ~z~Well in that case...

CHRC3_INT_32 = ~z~Tilly!

CHRC3_INT_33 = ~z~You free?

CHRC3_INT_34 = ~z~We got some work.

CHRC3_INT_LI_1 = ~z~What are you doing?

CHRC3_L1B_1 = ~z~You take the honors, Arthur. Grab the loot from inside.

CHRC3_L1CCONT_1 = ~z~So much for a 'couple of guards'.

CHRC3_L1CCONT_2 = ~z~Ah, we dealt with them no trouble.

CHRC3_L1C_1 = ~z~We made a right mess of that.

CHRC3_L1C_2 = ~z~We stopped it didn't we?

CHRC3_L1C_3 = ~z~Yeah, after chasing it all over New Hanover with God knows who watching.

CHRC3_L1REM_01 = ~z~Are you getting the money then?

CHRC3_L1REM_02 = ~z~Go on, Arthur.

CHRC3_L1REM_03 = ~z~I said, you have the honors.

CHRC3_L1_1 = ~z~That's all of them.

CHRC3_L2_1 = ~z~Got it. Right, let's split up and get the hell out of here.

CHRC3_L2_2 = ~z~Okay but you owe me my cut, don't think I'll forget.

CHRC3_L2_3 = ~z~I know, I know. Go on.

CHRC3_LOCKED_1 = ~z~Damn, it's locked.

CHRC3_P1_1 = ~z~Okay. Follow me.

CHRC3_P1_2 = ~z~There's a good spot where we should be able to cut it off northwest of Dewberry Creek.

CHRC3_P4_1 = ~z~Okay, here we are.

CHRC3_PDYN_1 = ~z~I'm gonna blow it open, stand back.

CHRC3_PSHOOT_1 = ~z~I'll shoot it, stand back.

CHRC3_STOPHORSE_01 = ~z~Whoa!

CHRC3_STOPHORSE_02 = ~z~Hold up!

CHRC3_STOPHORSE_03 = ~z~Stop, dammit!

CHRC3_STOPHORSE_04 = ~z~Whoa, whoa!

CHRC3_STOPHORSE_05 = ~z~Whoa now!

CHRC3_STOPHORSE_06 = ~z~Easy, easy!

CHRC3_TILWHAT_1 = ~z~Sure, what kind of work?

CHRC3_TILWHAT_2 = ~z~Stagecoach.

CHRC3_TILWHAT_3 = ~z~Sounds good. Let's do it.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_1 = ~z~Yes, I'm certain.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_2 = ~z~So what's the plan?

CHRC3_TOAMB1_3 = ~z~I was thinking a little womanly distraction.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_4 = ~z~I figured that much. But what's the story? Route, number of guards... you know, important details.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_5 = ~z~Just do exactly what I say and you'll be fine, alright?

CHRC3_TOAMB1_6 = ~z~How about we do exactly what Tilly says? I'd feel a lot safer.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_7 = ~z~Because I've done all the groundwork on this.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_8 = ~z~Next time she brings in a lead of her own, we'll all bow down, I promise.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_9 = ~z~I'll remember you said that.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_10 = ~z~You follow orders, you stay alive. That's what they used to tell me in the army.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_11 = ~z~They kicked you out of the army.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_12 = ~z~They did not!

CHRC3_TOAMB1_13 = ~z~I beg to differ, Marion.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_14 = ~z~Have you been going through my things?

CHRC3_TOAMB1_15 = ~z~You shouldn't have left it out.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_16 = ~z~Can you believe this, Morgan? I don't trust her any more than I trust that Kieran boy.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_17 = ~z~I never have. Running with them Foreman Boys all them years. She could turn on us any minute.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_18 = ~z~Just shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you. You have no damn clue.

CHRC3_TOAMB1_19 = ~z~Alright, just take it easy, you two. Get your minds on what matters so we do this right.

CHRC3_TOAMB2_1 = ~z~You know,~rp~ this was the spot we first picked out for camp?

CHRC3_TOAMB2_2 = ~z~A dry riverbed?

CHRC3_TOAMB2_3 = ~z~Yep.

CHRC3_TOAMB2_4 = ~z~Who the hell suggested that?

CHRC3_TOAMB2_5 = ~z~Micah, I believe.

CHRC3_TOAMB2_6 = ~z~Well that don't surprise me.

CHRC3_TOAMBINT1_1 = ~z~And you're certain this information is sound, Bill?

CHRC3_TOAMBINT1_2 = ~z~After that mess with the Cornwall stage, I want to make sure we're not riding into another army of guards.

CHRC3_TOAMBINT2_1 = ~z~And you're certain this information is sound, Bill?

CHRC3_TOHORSE_1 = ~z~Alright, come on. Let's mount up.

CHRC3_WAITDYN_01 = ~z~Go on then.

CHRC3_WAITDYN_02 = ~z~Are you going to blow it or not?

CHRC3_WAITDYN_03 = ~z~We shouldn't take too long over this.

CHRC3_WAITSHOOT_01 = ~z~Shoot it then.

CHRC3_WAITSHOOT_02 = ~z~I'm waiting.

CHRC3_WAITSHOOT_03 = ~z~No time like the present.
