0xB7C7F3F6 = ~z~Mhm... Capitale it is...

0xB7EF24EA = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~and moments later, a prized jewel goes missing...~sl:0.5:2.0~A coincidence, I'm sure...

0xB53DC675 = ~z~Got a brand-new job right here, up your street, I reckon

0xB56A0985 = ~z~~sl:1.5~I only mention it to absolve you of any misguided sympathy you might feel for these people.

0xB239E39F = ~z~Try that one again later.

0xB497C210 = ~z~Well that opportunity's worth more Capitale than you got to give...

0xB844FE2D = ~z~~sl:2.0:3.0~Once you're in my business for long enough,~sl:~you come to distrust appearances.

0xBB340567 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Now, Capitale ain't fair game.~sl:~You know that and I know that. But it seems that's a lesson we must teach.

0xBF1E4A70 = ~z~You made short work of that business over in Saint Denis.

0xC9ED2093 = ~z~~sl:1.5:3.0~There's men who know when to throw in their cards.~sl:0.5~And then, there's those who make a mistake, and double down.

0xC22D36D0 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~Not so.~sl:1.0:2.5~It seems we must repeat ourselves.~sl:0.5:1.5~And this time,~sl:~our meaning must not be in doubt.

0xD99FE7E4 = ~z~can't undertake a private initiative without the criminal classes taking advantage of it...

0xD862CFAD = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~A little la-di-da, of course, like all city folk...~sl:~But this is the kind of client James Langton needs...

0xD5953DD8 = ~z~This Martelli feller knows how to cast a net...

0xD2552910 = ~z~I thought so...

0xDAAA5405 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~They owe a debt to our employer.~sl:~And they got Capitale that ain't theirs.
