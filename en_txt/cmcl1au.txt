CMCL1_WNT_1 = ~z~Listen, Morgan... I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I-I thought they would shoot me, not you.

CMCL1_WNT_2 = ~z~What happened?

CMCL1_WNT_3 = ~z~The whole thing was odd...

CMCL1_WNT_4 = ~z~I kept waiting for... for them to jump us, and then they left and we assumed we'd meet you on the trail back.

CMCL1_WNT_5 = ~z~You never showed up...

CMCL1_WNT_6 = ~z~No... I was getting special guest treatment from Colm O'Driscoll.

CMCL1_WNT_7 = ~z~So I heard... I'm sorry.

CMCL1_WNT_8 = ~z~One time I-I try to... be wise and careful and make a damn fool of myself. That'll teach me...
