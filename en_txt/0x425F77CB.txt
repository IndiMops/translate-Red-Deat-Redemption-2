LBCAR_CARRYDEAD_1 = ~z~Help me. Someone. Any kind soul in hearing of this?

LBCAR_CLOSE_01 = ~z~Don't!

LBCAR_CLOSE_02 = ~z~No!

LBCAR_CLOSE_03 = ~z~Don't you...

LBCAR_COMBAT1_01 = ~z~Try and catch me.

LBCAR_COMBAT1_02 = ~z~Time to slip away...

LBCAR_COMBAT1_03 = ~z~Now you see me...

LBCAR_COMBAT1_04 = ~z~See if you can follow.

LBCAR_COMBAT1_05 = ~z~Come on, chase me!

LBCAR_COMBAT1_06 = ~z~I'm late for a very important date...

LBCAR_COMBAT1_07 = ~z~Down the rabbit hole...

LBCAR_COMBAT1_08 = ~z~Come deeper with me...

LBCAR_COMBAT2_01 = ~z~Put that rope away, you won't get me with that.

LBCAR_COMBAT2_02 = ~z~Try and rope the vapors.

LBCAR_COMBAT2_03 = ~z~I'd have to be real for you to rope me.

LBCAR_COMBATH1_01 = ~z~Feels real, doesn't it?

LBCAR_COMBATH1_02 = ~z~Are you dreaming?

LBCAR_COMBATH1_03 = ~z~Wake up!

LBCAR_COMBATH1_04 = ~z~It's a nightmare.

LBCAR_COMBATH1_05 = ~z~Snap out of it.

LBCAR_COMBATH1_06 = ~z~Let me help you wake up.

LBCAR_COMBATH1_07 = ~z~Sleep no more!

LBCAR_COMBATH1_08 = ~z~Let me put you out your misery.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_01 = ~z~You can't kill a dream.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_02 = ~z~If only it was as simple as killing me.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_03 = ~z~It's no use... give up.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_04 = ~z~It will take more than that to kill me.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_05 = ~z~You're wasting your efforts.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_06 = ~z~It's a fools errand... I promise you.

LBCAR_COMBATH2_07 = ~z~Continue to try, and you'll continue to fail...

LBCAR_COMBATH2_08 = ~z~You're only fighting the vapors.

LBCAR_CROCCHASE_01 = ~z~It looks like they don't want me to leave.

LBCAR_CROCCHASE_02 = ~z~Quick, aren't they? You have to watch them.

LBCAR_CROCCHASE_03 = ~z~They've been trying this for years.

LBCAR_CROCFLEE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.2~What a waste of a good alligator.

LBCAR_CROC_1 = ~z~Good gator!

LBCAR_DISAPEAR1_01 = ~z~I'm afraid I must leave you...

LBCAR_DISAPEAR1_04 = ~z~I'm being called away.

LBCAR_DISAPEAR2_01 = ~z~You missed me.

LBCAR_DISAPEAR2_04 = ~z~Au revoir.

LBCAR_DISAPEAR2_05 = ~z~Look what's happening.

LBCAR_DISAPEAR2_06 = ~z~I can do this all day.

LBCAR_DISAPEAR2_07 = ~z~Goodbye again.

LBCAR_DISAPEAR2_08 = ~z~Until we meet again.

LBCAR_ESCAPE1_1 = ~z~Slipped out. Didn't think I'd be so thin!

LBCAR_ESCAPE1_2 = ~z~If there's one thing I know it's running.

LBCAR_ESCAPE1_3 = ~z~If it's something else, it's hiding.

LBCAR_ESCAPE2_01 = ~z~Okay fine. You got me. Again.

LBCAR_ESCAPE2_02 = ~z~Ugh, no.

LBCAR_FIGHT_1 = ~z~I killed him and I'll kill you, too!

LBCAR_FOUND1_01 = ~z~Never!

LBCAR_FOUND1_02 = ~z~Never!

LBCAR_FOUND1_03 = ~z~I won't go!

LBCAR_FOUND1_04 = ~z~He's dead!

LBCAR_FOUND1_05 = ~z~I'm not him anymore!

LBCAR_FOUND1_06 = ~z~Carlier's dead!

LBCAR_FOUND1_07 = ~z~Carlier's dead!

LBCAR_HALLU1_02 = ~z~We thought we'd lost you...

LBCAR_HALLU1_03 = ~z~I told you it came on strong...

LBCAR_HALLU1_04 = ~z~You're having a time of it alright...

LBCAR_HALLU1_M_01 = ~z~I'm glad I caught you alone.

LBCAR_HALLU1_M_02 = ~z~It's nice to have you all to myself.

LBCAR_HALLU1_M_03 = ~z~I was hoping to catch you like this...

LBCAR_HALLU1_M_04 = ~z~It looks like it's just you and I here...

LBCAR_HALLU1_S_01 = ~z~How you feeling, huh?

LBCAR_HALLU1_S_02 = ~z~You don't look so good.

LBCAR_HALLU2_01 = ~z~You look like you're struggling there.

LBCAR_HALLU2_02 = ~z~You can't even stand straight.

LBCAR_HALLU2_03 = ~z~Strong vapors aren't they...

LBCAR_HALLU2_04 = ~z~Just the tonic, ain't it now?

LBCAR_HALLU3_01 = ~z~

LBCAR_HALLU3_02 = ~z~

LBCAR_HALLU3_03 = ~z~

LBCAR_HALLU3_04 = ~z~

LBCAR_HIT_01 = ~z~Please!

LBCAR_HIT_02 = ~z~Don't!

LBCAR_HIT_03 = ~z~Why, really!

LBCAR_HIT_04 = ~z~That's uncalled for.

LBCAR_HOGTIED_01 = ~z~Don't tie me up.

LBCAR_HOGTIED_02 = ~z~I am quite well behaved... ask anyone I know.

LBCAR_HOGTIED_03 = ~z~This is really quite unnecessary.

LBCAR_IDLE_01 = ~z~I wasn't hurting anyone out there.

LBCAR_IDLE_02 = ~z~Let me go back to the bayou.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_1 = ~z~Mr. Philip Carlier.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_2 = ~z~I don't know where to start with this one.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_3 = ~z~I remember when his poster first went up.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_4 = ~z~Mild mannered they said.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_5 = ~z~Well, they all are, until they ain't.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_6 = ~z~I might have even looked for him too...

LBCAR_INT_BINK_7 = ~z~but none of us could find him.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_8 = ~z~It sounds like they spotted him in the swamps.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_9 = ~z~If that's where he's been, on the run all this time...

LBCAR_INT_BINK_10 = ~z~then God help him.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_11 = ~z~Ain't much in the way of company out there.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_12 = ~z~Or much that won't try and eat you or put you on a pike.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_13 = ~z~Got to ask what years of that might have done to his mind.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_14 = ~z~You're here.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_15 = ~z~You're here. Oh, thank heavens you're here.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_16 = ~z~See, I've been here for... must be years.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_17 = ~z~Trapped.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_18 = ~z~You see, I-I thought no one would ever come.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_19 = ~z~Philip Carlier, the Castille Cotton Company chief clerk.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_20 = ~z~But... I'm sure you already know that given why you're here.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_21 = ~z~My, my, I... I can't imagine how I must look.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_22 = ~z~No, no time for any of that. Now...

LBCAR_INT_BINK_23 = ~z~if you'd just let me...

LBCAR_INT_BINK_24 = ~z~Oh.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_25 = ~z~I was so hoping for someone to share this with.

LBCAR_INT_BINK_26 = ~z~It comes on rather strong the first time, does it not?

LBCAR_KILLED_01 = ~z~A brave attempt.

LBCAR_KILLED_02 = ~z~I didn't have the constitution.

LBCAR_KILLED_03 = ~z~Got the better of you, didn't it?

LBCAR_KILLED_04 = ~z~Not sound enough of mind...

LBCAR_LASSO_01 = ~z~Get that rope off of me.

LBCAR_LASSO_02 = ~z~Don't do this!

LBCAR_NIGHTFOLK_04 = ~z~The bayou protects its own!

LBCAR_OFFICE_1 = ~z~I don't want to go in there.

LBCAR_OFFICE_2 = ~z~I'm not ready to go to jail, please.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR1_01 = ~z~And now I'm over here...

LBCAR_REAPPEAR1_02 = ~z~I couldn't leave you all alone.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR1_03 = ~z~I came back as soon as I could.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR1_04 = ~z~I hope I wasn't missed.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_01 = ~z~Over here.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_02 = ~z~Behind you.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_03 = ~z~This way.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_04 = ~z~Pardon.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_05 = ~z~Watch your back!

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_06 = ~z~Watch yourself.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_07 = ~z~Excuse me.

LBCAR_REAPPEAR2_08 = ~z~Look out.

LBCAR_RIDEAWAY_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~Oh, take me back to the bayou?~sl:~I won't hurt anyone, hey, that's a promise...

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_1 = ~z~~sl:1.2~How you feeling? ~rp~Clear-eyed again, I hope, yes?

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Yeah, those vapors, they are quite strong.~sl:~Yes, yes... yes, quite strong indeed.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Now, you may not believe me, but you made a mistake.~sl:0.7~You've got the wrong man, you see, it's

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Mr. Philip ~rp~Carlier? Of the Castille Cotton Company?~sl:~Yeah, he, he gone. ~rp~He died a long time ago, I'm afraid.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_5 = ~z~~sl:0.6~I know it's very disappointing for a bounty hunter, but... there it is.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I promise you, ~rp~I saw him dead.~sl:~His body committed to the swamp, I...

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~I saw the skin rotting off his bones and~sl:0.0:2.3~creatures feeding upon his flesh.~sl:~~rp~The man is as dead as you and me is breathing now, I...

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_8 = ~z~I... he's dead, you must believe me.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_9 = ~z~~sl:0.2:3.2~How do you think anyone could survive out here?~sl:0.0:1.6~For all this time?~sl:0.0:1.0~I mean, really.~sl:0.0:2.7~~rp~It's a ridiculous proposition if you think of it...~sl:0.6~For a man as...

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~as polite and unsuited to the environment as...~sl:0.0:2.8~as poor Mr. Carlier.~sl:0.7~~rp~He perished very quickly, I assure you.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Yeah, one night with the gators, and the snakes, and the...~sl:0.0:3.2:1~and the Night Folk? That was more than enough.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7:1~It was a mercy. ~rp~A mercy, I promise.

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_13 = ~z~~sl:0.2:5.0~You must understand, ~rp~Philip Carlier's dead!~sl:0.2~~rp~Why won't you understand that?

LBCAR_RIDEBANT_14 = ~z~

LBCAR_RUNOFF_1 = ~z~Stay away!

LBCAR_SPLITM_01 = ~z~Where's the rest of your party, you think?

LBCAR_SPLITM_02 = ~z~Call out, see if anyone can hear you.

LBCAR_SPLITM_03 = ~z~Where do you think they are, huh?

LBCAR_SPLITM_04 = ~z~Getting awfully lonely out here, I bet.

LBCAR_SPLITS_01 = ~z~Sounded like night terrors over here.

LBCAR_SPLITS_02 = ~z~Having a bad dream?

LBCAR_SPOT_1 = ~z~You again...

LBCAR_TWITCH_01 = ~z~Found...

LBCAR_TWITCH_02 = ~z~Caught...
