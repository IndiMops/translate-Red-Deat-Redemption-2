CKPT3_13_2 = ~z~Only waves in the air.

CKPT3_13_3 = ~z~This is remarkable... think of those poor boys on the H.L. Hunley. Eight of them perished to a mere five on the Housatonic...

CKPT3_13_4 = ~z~And what a way to go... trapped in a box at the bottom of the bay.

CKPT3_13_5 = ~z~I suppose you intend to make an unmanned killing machine?

CKPT3_13_6 = ~z~You misunderstand. This is the secret to life, not death.

CKPT3_13_7 = ~z~The transmigration of the soul... I make lifeless metal breathe like man.

CKPTB_N2B_1 = ~z~Use these ones to steer. And this one to shoot torpedoes. Okay?

CKPTB_N2B_2 = ~z~Yes, now blow up the little battle ships, and avoid the sea mines. They have magnets attached.

CKPTB_N2B_3 = ~z~Make nasty explosion if they touch the boat.

CKPTB_N2B_4 = ~z~Okay! If this silly dimwit can use torpedoes on boat to destroy the battle ships...

CKPTB_N2B_5 = ~z~imagine what technology can do in hands of a certified genius.

CKPTB_N2B_6 = ~z~And I have certificate.

CKPTB_N3B_A_1 = ~z~Hey, it is doing what I'm telling it.

CKPTB_N3B_A_2 = ~z~Of course it is doing. Now tell it do closer to battle ship and shoot with torpedo.

CKPTB_PRMPT_01 = ~z~A quick demonstration is a good demonstration, yes?

CKPTB_PRMPT_02 = ~z~If this was all a setup, it wouldn't be taking so long.

CKPTB_PRMPT_03 = ~z~Watch and marvel as this man's ineptitude travels thirty feet through air to that little boat.

CKPTB_PRMPT_04 = ~z~Please shoot the thing with torpedo and stop making me look bad.

CKPTB_RET_01 = ~z~You played your part. Now please, go.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_11 = ~z~that will astound all of you.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_12 = ~z~Mr. Marcelle...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_13 = ~z~can I count on your support?

RCKPT_S1_EXT_14 = ~z~Well...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_15 = ~z~this is expensive.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_16 = ~z~It is immortality...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_17 = ~z~sir, it is...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_18 = ~z~it is very cheap.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_19 = ~z~Perhaps over lunch?

RCKPT_S1_EXT_20 = ~z~Maybe.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_21 = ~z~I'm going to go.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_22 = ~z~Oh, of course...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_23 = ~z~and thank you...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_24 = ~z~if you are ever up near Doverhill pay me a visit...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_LO_4 = ~z~And this is for military purposes?

RCKPT_S1_EXT_LO_5 = ~z~No... it is for humanity itself.

RCKPT_S1_EXT_LO_6 = ~z~You see... you see...

RCKPT_S1_EXT_LO_7 = ~z~I have now illustrated just a small sliver of the miracles I can enact on this earth if you will help me,

RCKPT_S1_EXT_LO_8 = ~z~and not stab me in the ass like the other Americans. Traitors!

RCKPT_S1_EXT_LO_9 = ~z~All of you, goddamn traitors!

RCKPT_S1_INT_5 = ~z~I'm inclined to agree.

RCKPT_S1_INT_6 = ~z~Here, help me please...

RCKPT_S1_INT_7 = ~z~back to work with a bloody smile.

RCKPT_S1_INT_8 = ~z~No problem, Marko...

RCKPT_S1_INT_9 = ~z~you are the great genius...

RCKPT_S1_INT_10 = ~z~so we shove the hot poker up the ass.

RCKPT_S1_INT_11 = ~z~Say thank you, Marko...

RCKPT_S1_INT_12 = ~z~"Thank you. Oh, thank you."

RCKPT_S1_INT_13 = ~z~What are you, some kinda European toy maker?

RCKPT_S1_INT_26 = ~z~and not pay the money to, yes.

RCKPT_S1_INT_27 = ~z~He total shit man.

RCKPT_S1_INT_28 = ~z~So, what's this toy about?

RCKPT_S1_INT_29 = ~z~It is not a toy, big nuts...

RCKPT_S1_INT_30 = ~z~it is demonstration of my genius...

RCKPT_S1_INT_31 = ~z~of my ideas about the source of life.

RCKPT_S1_INT_32 = ~z~Ah, it's a toy boat.

RCKPT_S1_INT_33 = ~z~Yes, it is a 'toy boat' that I can power remotely...

RCKPT_S1_INT_34 = ~z~using electricity and waves you cannot see.

RCKPT_S1_INT_35 = ~z~Good for you...

RCKPT_S1_INT_36 = ~z~waves I cannot see.

RCKPT_S1_INT_37 = ~z~And still the investors will not come...

RCKPT_S1_INT_38 = ~z~just a couple of old ladies and a moron.

RCKPT_S1_INT_39 = ~z~Ladies, please.

RCKPT_S1_INT_40 = ~z~Ladies, gentleman...

RCKPT_S1_INT_41 = ~z~enchante.

RCKPT_S1_INT_49 = ~z~All of us, we feel old...

RCKPT_S1_INT_50 = ~z~you, you are old...

RCKPT_S1_INT_51 = ~z~but, maybe I can make you immortal.

RCKPT_S1_INT_52 = ~z~Using waves you cannot see, I will power this boat...

RCKPT_S1_INT_53 = ~z~You're a goddamn fraud...

RCKPT_S1_INT_54 = ~z~and this buffoon dressed up like a buffoon...

RCKPT_S1_INT_55 = ~z~is a stoolie.

RCKPT_S1_INT_56 = ~z~I watched them conspire, you morons.

RCKPT_S1_INT_57 = ~z~I never met this buffoon before two minutes ago.

RCKPT_S1_INT_58 = ~z~Isn't that right?

RCKPT_S1_INT_59 = ~z~Which part of it?

RCKPT_S1_INT_60 = ~z~So, Professor, show us your magical toy boat...

RCKPT_S1_INT_61 = ~z~only this time let the buffoon control it...

RCKPT_S1_INT_62 = ~z~check if there's any funny business.

RCKPT_S1_INT_63 = ~z~No, this ain't nothing to do with me.

RCKPT_S1_INT_64 = ~z~Come, please, please...

RCKPT_S1_INT_65 = ~z~it is easy...

RCKPT_S1_INT_66 = ~z~any moron could do it...

RCKPT_S1_INT_67 = ~z~and I am about to prove that.

RCKPT_S1_INT_68 = ~z~Here, take this...

RCKPT_S1_INT_69 = ~z~and this, and...

RCKPT_S1_INT_70 = ~z~don't touch that.

RCKPT_S1_INT_71 = ~z~You okay, buddy?

RCKPT_S1_INT_72 = ~z~I'm inclined to agree.

RCKPT_S2_INT_3 = ~z~Hello?

RCKPT_S2_INT_4 = ~z~If you are here to rob me...

RCKPT_S2_INT_5 = ~z~I wish to make clear that I have weapons...

RCKPT_S2_INT_6 = ~z~that could liquefy each of your internal organs in turn...

RCKPT_S2_INT_7 = ~z~and leave you...

RCKPT_S2_INT_8 = ~z~just a puddle on the floor.

RCKPT_S2_INT_9 = ~z~He did?

RCKPT_S2_INT_10 = ~z~Oh, oh, the buffoon...

RCKPT_S2_INT_11 = ~z~yes, he did.

RCKPT_S2_INT_12 = ~z~Hello!

RCKPT_S2_INT_23 = ~z~I hope I'm not disturbing you.

RCKPT_S2_INT_24 = ~z~Of course you are disturbing me, buddy.

RCKPT_S2_INT_25 = ~z~I almost solved biggest problem...

RCKPT_S2_INT_26 = ~z~and you mess it up.

RCKPT_S2_INT_27 = ~z~I did?

RCKPT_S2_INT_28 = ~z~No, but I did.

RCKPT_S2_INT_29 = ~z~I can't get the bloody conductor straight.

RCKPT_S2_INT_30 = ~z~Uh, well, well, well. Well...

RCKPT_S2_INT_31 = ~z~it is the geometry of life...

RCKPT_S2_INT_32 = ~z~the grand theory of power...

RCKPT_S2_INT_33 = ~z~the grand theory of theories.

RCKPT_S2_INT_34 = ~z~There is just one more, big problem...

RCKPT_S2_INT_35 = ~z~and maybe I solve it, but...

RCKPT_S2_INT_36 = ~z~I can't get it right.

RCKPT_S2_INT_37 = ~z~I don't understand.

RCKPT_S2_INT_38 = ~z~Of course you don't.

RCKPT_S2_INT_39 = ~z~Help me adjust these things and...

RCKPT_S2_INT_40 = ~z~I will show you what I mean.

RCKPT_S2_INT_42 = ~z~Whoa, well I...  I'm not much of a scientist.

RCKPT_S2_INT_43 = ~z~Yeah, well...

RCKPT_S2_INT_44 = ~z~you are an American.

RCKPT_S2_INT_45 = ~z~Science is far beyond you, but...

RCKPT_S2_INT_46 = ~z~you make a fine buffoon.

RCKPT_S2_INT_47 = ~z~Go...

RCKPT_S2_INT_48 = ~z~Hello?

RCKPT_S2_INT_59 = ~z~Oh, okay, but... I'm not much of a scientist.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_1 = ~z~Wonderful.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_2 = ~z~I wish I ever went to school...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_3 = ~z~so I had a clue what was going on.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_4 = ~z~What now?

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_5 = ~z~Now, I become the second creature...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_6 = ~z~after God himself to bring life ...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_7 = ~z~to this earth.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_8 = ~z~Like...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_9 = ~z~this!

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_10 = ~z~Am I missing something?

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_11 = ~z~The switches...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_13 = ~z~Okay...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_14 = ~z~climb up there...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_15 = ~z~and adjust them for me.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_16 = ~z~Go, quick please.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_17 = ~z~I wish I'd ever gone to school...

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_18 = ~z~and had a clue of what was going on.

RCKPT_S2_MCS1_19 = ~z~What now?
