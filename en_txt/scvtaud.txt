SCVT_0192A_1 = ~z~Hey, ain't you that feller who beat down Tommy in the street?

SCVT_0192B_1 = ~z~No skin off my nose, partner. Never really liked that big bastard anyway.

SCVT_0192B_2 = ~z~Mind you, he's gone kinda slow ever since.

SCVT_0192B_3 = ~z~You got a hell of a punch on you.

SCVT_0192B_4 = ~z~Well, anyways... didn't mean to keep you from your drink.

SCVT_0971A_1 = ~z~You here for the auction then?

SCVT_0971B_1 = ~z~Well, if you ain't here for the sheep,

SCVT_0971B_2 = ~z~you won't get much more in Valentine... except shit on your shoes and a punch in the face.

SCVT_0971B_3 = ~z~I swear, if I never see a sheep again, it'll be too soon. Bleating little shits.

SCVT_0971B_4 = ~z~I have dreams some nights of going over to that auction yard and gunning them all down.

SCVT_0971B_5 = ~z~Anyways... enough of that.

SCVT_0975A_1 = ~z~You been in town long?

SCVT_0975B_1 = ~z~Well, you probably heard everyone talking about the 'curse' here? Maybe not...

SCVT_0975B_2 = ~z~Folk reckon luck runs bad in this town and the superstitious among them reckon that ain't no coincidence.

SCVT_0975B_3 = ~z~Me, I reckon a man makes his own luck. Ain't no church nor curse gonna change it.

SCVT_0975B_4 = ~z~But what do you care anyway, huh?

SCVT_0976A_1 = ~z~Don't often see many new faces in here.

SCVT_0976B_1 = ~z~This here used to be the only and best saloon in Valentine...

SCVT_0976B_2 = ~z~till they opened that modern monstrosity, Smithfields, down the way.

SCVT_0976B_3 = ~z~This town don't need two saloons... but, you know, them fancy Dans can keep it.

SCVT_0976B_4 = ~z~Don't want 'em drinking anywhere near me.

SCVT_0976B_5 = ~z~Nah, I'm just fine here, thank you very much.

SCVT_1057A_1 = ~z~So you here for the auction?

SCVT_1057B_1 = ~z~Because my advice would be to steer well clear of the feller who runs that auction yard.

SCVT_1057B_2 = ~z~Morris Peyton's his name.

SCVT_1057B_3 = ~z~Crooked as a dog's hind leg. More of a friend to the rustlers than any working man.

SCVT_1057B_4 = ~z~And does Sheriff Malloy do anything about it? Of course he don't... they're all in it together.

SCVT_1057B_5 = ~z~Anyways, I can see you ain't interested in any of this, so... I'll just shut my mouth...
