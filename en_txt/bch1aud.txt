BCH1_RSC1_1 = ~z~Hey, son...

BCH1_RSC1_2 = ~z~how's that bull?

BCH1_RSC1_3 = ~z~Fine, Mr. Milton.

BCH1_RSC1_4 = ~z~Your father in?

BCH1_RSC1_5 = ~z~Could I have a word?

BCH1_RSC1_6 = ~z~Sure...

BCH1_RSC1_7 = ~z~I'll just get him.

BCH1_RSC1_8 = ~z~Pa.

BCH1_RSC1_9 = ~z~Yeah I'm right, right here...

BCH1_RSC1_10 = ~z~What's the problem, Milton?

BCH1_RSC1_11 = ~z~I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.

BCH1_RSC1_12 = ~z~Oh, no problem.

BCH1_RSC1_13 = ~z~My wife...

BCH1_RSC1_14 = ~z~she just began her morning discourse...

BCH1_RSC1_15 = ~z~on the subject of my faults.

BCH1_RSC1_16 = ~z~An experience I think every man can relate to.

BCH1_RSC1_17 = ~z~In some ways.

BCH1_RSC1_18 = ~z~My wife...

BCH1_RSC1_19 = ~z~my wife also has...

BCH1_RSC1_20 = ~z~issues with some of the decisions I've made.

BCH1_RSC1_21 = ~z~Real issues.

BCH1_RSC1_22 = ~z~Do you believe a man can change, sir?

BCH1_RSC1_23 = ~z~Where is this heading?

BCH1_RSC1_24 = ~z~I guess I don't know.

BCH1_RSC1_25 = ~z~I've tried to be a good hand.

BCH1_RSC1_26 = ~z~I've worked hard to secure your property...

BCH1_RSC1_27 = ~z~And for that we are grateful.

BCH1_RSC1_28 = ~z~and you've paid me well, besides.

BCH1_RSC1_29 = ~z~The thing is, I suppose...

BCH1_RSC1_30 = ~z~I need to get a place of my own...

BCH1_RSC1_31 = ~z~so I can prove to my wife that I've changed.

BCH1_RSC1_32 = ~z~I understand.

BCH1_RSC1_33 = ~z~But...

BCH1_RSC1_34 = ~z~I ain't got much money.

BCH1_RSC1_35 = ~z~I ain't asking to borrow none...

BCH1_RSC1_36 = ~z~but maybe you could...

BCH1_RSC1_37 = ~z~go to the bank and...

BCH1_RSC1_38 = ~z~put in a good word...

BCH1_RSC1_39 = ~z~so they could give me a loan?

BCH1_RSC1_40 = ~z~A loan, huh?

BCH1_RSC1_41 = ~z~So I can buy that place, Beecher's Hope?

BCH1_RSC1_42 = ~z~Yes, I know it.

BCH1_RSC1_43 = ~z~Yes of course, sure.

BCH1_RSC1_44 = ~z~It'd be...

BCH1_RSC1_45 = ~z~be my pleasure...

BCH1_RSC1_46 = ~z~but take my advice, Milton...

BCH1_RSC1_47 = ~z~take your money...

BCH1_RSC1_48 = ~z~and go buy passage on a boat.

BCH1_RSC1_49 = ~z~Go to Brazil and...

BCH1_RSC1_50 = ~z~forget all about family.

BCH1_RSC1_51 = ~z~I'm just joking, son.

BCH1_RSC1_52 = ~z~Just make sure you deal with Ansel Atherton at the bank.

BCH1_RSC1_53 = ~z~He's a distant cousin.

BCH1_RSC1_54 = ~z~Use my name...

BCH1_RSC1_55 = ~z~tell him to ask me direct himself.

BCH1_RSC1_56 = ~z~You'll get what you need.

BCH1_RSC1_57 = ~z~Thank you, sir.

BCH1_RSC1_58 = ~z~Yeah, I was young and dumb once too...

BCH1_RSC1_59 = ~z~you'll get her back.

BCH1_RSC1_LI_1 = ~z~

BCH1_RSC1_LI_2 = ~z~Hey son, how's that bull?

BCH1_RSC1_LI_3 = ~z~Fine, Mr. Milton.

BCH1_RSC2_1 = ~z~Can I help you?

BCH1_RSC2_2 = ~z~I hope so.

BCH1_RSC2_3 = ~z~I want a loan, sir.

BCH1_RSC2_4 = ~z~A line of credit...

BCH1_RSC2_5 = ~z~so I can buy some property.

BCH1_RSC2_6 = ~z~What property?

BCH1_RSC2_7 = ~z~Can I help you?

BCH1_RSC2_8 = ~z~I hope so.

BCH1_RSC2_9 = ~z~I want a loan, sir.

BCH1_RSC2_10 = ~z~A line of credit...

BCH1_RSC2_11 = ~z~so I can buy some property.

BCH1_RSC2_12 = ~z~What property?

BCH1_RSC2_13 = ~z~An old ranch...

BCH1_RSC2_14 = ~z~Beecher's Hope.

BCH1_RSC2_15 = ~z~That old dump?

BCH1_RSC2_16 = ~z~I-I know it ain't much...

BCH1_RSC2_17 = ~z~but I ain't much of a farmer either.

BCH1_RSC2_18 = ~z~But, I will get there.

BCH1_RSC2_19 = ~z~That is a very unusual way of asking for a loan, Mr...?

BCH1_RSC2_20 = ~z~M... Marston.

BCH1_RSC2_21 = ~z~Marston.

BCH1_RSC2_22 = ~z~Only folk around here call me Milton...

BCH1_RSC2_23 = ~z~it's kind of a joke, I guess.

BCH1_RSC2_24 = ~z~A joke, huh?

BCH1_RSC2_25 = ~z~Which folk?

BCH1_RSC2_26 = ~z~Mr. Geddes.

BCH1_RSC2_27 = ~z~I work for him.

BCH1_RSC2_28 = ~z~He said that you could help me out...

BCH1_RSC2_29 = ~z~I mean, if you can.

BCH1_RSC2_30 = ~z~So old David Geddes told you I'm the kind of man...

BCH1_RSC2_31 = ~z~to loan a man with two names money...

BCH1_RSC2_32 = ~z~so he can buy a run-down farm...

BCH1_RSC2_33 = ~z~on account of his lack of farming skills, huh?

BCH1_RSC2_34 = ~z~Don't sound too promising when you put it like that.

BCH1_RSC2_35 = ~z~Well, how would you put it?

BCH1_RSC2_36 = ~z~Sorry to waste your time, sir.

BCH1_RSC2_37 = ~z~Oh, sit down, I'm sure we can figure something out.

BCH1_RSC2_38 = ~z~Now of course, we'll be expecting you to make regular payments...

BCH1_RSC2_39 = ~z~and given a lack of much evidence you got any means of repaying...

BCH1_RSC2_40 = ~z~the terms won't be too great...

BCH1_RSC2_41 = ~z~but, if my cousin vouches for you, it'll be okay with the bank.

BCH1_RSC2_42 = ~z~Really?

BCH1_RSC2_43 = ~z~Absolutely.

BCH1_RSC2_44 = ~z~Thank you.

BCH1_RSC2_45 = ~z~Now of course we'll be expecting our money back...

BCH1_RSC2_46 = ~z~regular as clockwork until the debt's settled.

BCH1_RSC2_47 = ~z~Otherwise the farm reverts to the bank...

BCH1_RSC2_48 = ~z~no matter how much you paid.

BCH1_RSC2_49 = ~z~I understand.

BCH1_RSC2_50 = ~z~Well, why don't you go check out the land...

BCH1_RSC2_51 = ~z~while I fix the contracts and talk to Mr. Geddes.

BCH1_RSC2_52 = ~z~Oh...

BCH1_RSC2_53 = ~z~I heard there's squatters up there.

BCH1_RSC2_54 = ~z~We've been having so many problems recently...

BCH1_RSC2_55 = ~z~they'll need clearing on.

BCH1_RSC2_56 = ~z~Sure.

BCH1_RSC2_57 = ~z~Well, come back when you're done...

BCH1_RSC2_58 = ~z~and we'll fix up the paperwork.

BCH1_RSC3_1 = ~z~Can I help you, friend?

BCH1_RSC3_2 = ~z~I hope so...

BCH1_RSC3_3 = ~z~Who's in charge here?

BCH1_RSC3_4 = ~z~No one, mister.

BCH1_RSC3_5 = ~z~This is a free country.

BCH1_RSC3_6 = ~z~Now that I ain't so sure about...

BCH1_RSC3_11 = ~z~Who's this?

BCH1_RSC3_12 = ~z~I ain't sure.

BCH1_RSC3_13 = ~z~Some fancy dan city boy...

BCH1_RSC3_14 = ~z~says he owns this land...

BCH1_RSC3_15 = ~z~or he's gonna.

BCH1_RSC3_16 = ~z~Owns it?
