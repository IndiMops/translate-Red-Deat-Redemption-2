CWDC3_ACTION_1 = ~z~So how are you liking life as a lawman?

CWDC3_ACTION_2 = ~z~What are we doing, Dutch?

CWDC3_ACTION_3 = ~z~Well, I think they call it hiding in plain sight.

CWDC3_ACTION_4 = ~z~Oh, Is that what they call it? 'Cause I got another word for it.

CWDC3_ACTION_5 = ~z~I'm sure that you have, but the way I see it, we stick out here either way.

CWDC3_ACTION_6 = ~z~Now, we can hide and skulk in the woods, we'll arouse more suspicion than if we act friendly and helpful...

CWDC3_ACTION_7 = ~z~Interesting theory... I wonder how the practical will work out.

CWDC3_ACTION_8 = ~z~We shall see. Faith, Arthur.
