TRN1_CLEAR_WAY_03 = ~z~Here come more, take'em down!

TRN1_DOCKS_01 = ~z~Come on. We don't have all day, cowpoke.

TRN1_DOCKS_02 = ~z~Let's go. Stop sulking like a spoiled little girl.

TRN1_DOCKS_03 = ~z~Let's move this along, Morgan. They're gonna be here soon.

TRN1_DOCKS_04 = ~z~Let's keep things moving, we look suspicious enough as it is.

TRN1_DUTCHBANT1_1 = ~z~We had enough heat on us before, now we're going to be torched, Dutch!

TRN1_DUTCHBANT1_2 = ~z~This is the only way. You'll see. Trust me.

TRN1_DUTCHBANT1_3 = ~z~Trust you?

TRN1_DUTCHBANT2_1 = ~z~You said this wasn't a revenge mission!

TRN1_DUTCHBANT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~It wasn't! We got what we came for.~sl:0.2~Those papers.

TRN1_EXT_1 = ~z~Whoa.

TRN1_EXT_2 = ~z~We all okay?

TRN1_EXT_3 = ~z~Interesting social call.

TRN1_EXT_4 = ~z~Don't play dumb and superior at the same time, Morgan.

TRN1_EXT_5 = ~z~We all knew sooner or later Cornwall had to go.

TRN1_EXT_6 = ~z~Let me see them papers.

TRN1_EXT_7 = ~z~It's more attention we don't need.

TRN1_EXT_8 = ~z~Feels like the whole world's closing in on us.

TRN1_EXT_9 = ~z~Dutch...

TRN1_EXT_10 = ~z~it won't be long before they find where we're hiding out now...

TRN1_EXT_11 = ~z~especially as we ain't exactly hiding out.

TRN1_EXT_12 = ~z~We just need a distraction.

TRN1_EXT_13 = ~z~Buy us some time.

TRN1_EXT_14 = ~z~It looks like Mr. Cornwall's company...

TRN1_EXT_15 = ~z~has signed a railroad contract with the army...

TRN1_EXT_16 = ~z~and they're also moving dynamite down from, well...

TRN1_EXT_17 = ~z~ the Annesburg mines to Saint Denis to resell.

TRN1_EXT_18 = ~z~And there's bonds at his oil factory.

TRN1_EXT_19 = ~z~Maybe there's a way to get them off our back...

TRN1_EXT_20 = ~z~and get the money that we need.

TRN1_EXT_21 = ~z~Micah, you look into this dynamite. Take Bill, I guess.

TRN1_EXT_22 = ~z~Arthur, you go too.

TRN1_EXT_23 = ~z~We are gonna need a lot of it.

TRN1_EXT_24 = ~z~And Micah, we need to talk.

TRN1_EXT_25 = ~z~Figure out some things.

TRN1_EXT_26 = ~z~Course, boss.

TRN1_EXT_27 = ~z~Figure out what?

TRN1_EXT_28 = ~z~The plan.

TRN1_EXT_29 = ~z~Getting outta here.

TRN1_EXT_30 = ~z~Nothing's changed.

TRN1_EXT_31 = ~z~It hasn't, huh?

TRN1_EXT_32 = ~z~There's an old house west of Van Horn.

TRN1_EXT_33 = ~z~Meet me there when you can, Black Lung.

TRN1_EXT_34 = ~z~Let's split up.

TRN1_EXT_35 = ~z~We'll meet up back at camp.

TRN1_EXT_36 = ~z~This is crazy.

TRN1_FOLLOW_ME_01 = ~z~This way, come on!

TRN1_IG1_FOUND1_2 = ~z~Come on! We gotta move.

TRN1_IG1_FOUND2_1 = ~z~~sl:2.8:1.8:1~I found something interesting.

TRN1_IG1_FOUND2_2 = ~z~Come on! We gotta move.

TRN1_IG1_FOUND3_1 = ~z~~sl:2.1:1.9:1~I found something interesting.

TRN1_IGWALK_1_1 = ~z~So, what are we going to say to him, that needs to be said?

TRN1_IGWALK_2_1 = ~z~He has been hunting us since Valentine.

TRN1_IGWALK_2_2 = ~z~He is the reason that Hosea got killed. His sugar business,

TRN1_IGWALK_2_3 = ~z~is destroying the people of Guarma.

TRN1_IGWALK_2_4 = ~z~This town, Arthur, is his town.

TRN1_IGWALK_2_5 = ~z~He bought it just to destroy these folks.

TRN1_IGWALK_2_6 = ~z~His sugar. His oil. His law.

TRN1_IGWALK_3_1 = ~z~These are wrongs that you can't right, Dutch. We're wanted men.

TRN1_IGWALK_4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.6:0.0~So why did you go for John against my wishes?

TRN1_IGWALK_4_2 = ~z~I didn't want him hanged.

TRN1_IGWALK_4_3 = ~z~Neither did I.

TRN1_IGWALK_5_1 = ~z~We're gonna cut a deal, Arthur.

TRN1_IGWALK_5_2 = ~z~What are you talking about?

TRN1_IGWALK_5_3 = ~z~We want out, and Cornwall wants us to stop robbing him...

TRN1_IGWALK_5_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~and we all know his money~sl:0.1~is what's keeping the Pinkertons on our tail.

TRN1_IGWALK_6_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~He's America, Arthur.~sl:0.3~And I want out.

TRN1_IGWALK_6_2 = ~z~And he... he won't let us go.

TRN1_IGWALK_7_1 = ~z~This ain't making a lot of sense, Dutch.

TRN1_IGWALK_7_2 = ~z~It will, son...

TRN1_IGWALK_7_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~It will... a deal... some noise...~sl:0.3~and then we're gone.

TRN1_INT_1 = ~z~Was you followed?

TRN1_INT_2 = ~z~No.

TRN1_INT_3 = ~z~Was you followed?

TRN1_INT_4 = ~z~I said...

TRN1_INT_5 = ~z~no!

TRN1_INT_6 = ~z~Okay.

TRN1_INT_7 = ~z~What is your problem?

TRN1_INT_8 = ~z~What is your problem, partner?

TRN1_INT_9 = ~z~You don't, uh...

TRN1_INT_10 = ~z~you don't look so good.

TRN1_INT_11 = ~z~What is wrong with you?

TRN1_INT_12 = ~z~Nothing wrong with me.

TRN1_INT_13 = ~z~I'm fit as a fiddle.

TRN1_INT_14 = ~z~Not inside you ain't.

TRN1_INT_15 = ~z~I'm just a realist, friend.

TRN1_INT_16 = ~z~Micah reckons there's a rat.

TRN1_INT_17 = ~z~Oh, does he?

TRN1_INT_18 = ~z~On what evidence?

TRN1_INT_19 = ~z~We's only back a minute, Pinkertons show up.

TRN1_INT_20 = ~z~We been on the run since you two fools went crazy in Blackwater.

TRN1_INT_21 = ~z~We barely escaped with our lives in Saint Denis...

TRN1_INT_22 = ~z~now we got a rat?

TRN1_INT_23 = ~z~Well, Molly clearly talked.

TRN1_INT_24 = ~z~But, who else?

TRN1_INT_25 = ~z~Maybe we pushed things too hard?

TRN1_INT_26 = ~z~Maybe time for folks like us is passed.

TRN1_INT_27 = ~z~We don't need a rat.

TRN1_INT_28 = ~z~We got sloppier than the town drunk...

TRN1_INT_29 = ~z~and they know who we are...

TRN1_INT_30 = ~z~and where we are...

TRN1_INT_31 = ~z~and what we're doing.

TRN1_INT_32 = ~z~Way I see it, best thing we can do is let the weak go...

TRN1_INT_33 = ~z~move on, get our money and start over.

TRN1_INT_34 = ~z~That ain't happening.

TRN1_INT_35 = ~z~Well, something's gotta happen, and fast.

TRN1_INT_36 = ~z~Otherwise, Cornwall, them Pinkertons...

TRN1_INT_37 = ~z~they've got us pinned in here, and ain't none of them stopping.

TRN1_INT_38 = ~z~Well, Cornwall's why we're here.

TRN1_INT_39 = ~z~Shall we, Dutch?

TRN1_INT_40 = ~z~Yeah, it's time to go.

TRN1_INT_41 = ~z~Let's head to the river.

TRN1_INT_42 = ~z~Ah, leave Cornwall alone.

TRN1_INT_43 = ~z~He ain't...

TRN1_INT_44 = ~z~look, we need money, but revenge?

TRN1_INT_45 = ~z~Now?

TRN1_INT_46 = ~z~Of course it's for money.

TRN1_INT_47 = ~z~Come on, Arthur.

TRN1_INT_48 = ~z~This better not be no stupid revenge mission, Dutch.

TRN1_INT_49 = ~z~It ain't worth it.

TRN1_INT_50 = ~z~Don't be ridiculous.

TRN1_INT_51 = ~z~Oh, Arthur...

TRN1_INT_52 = ~z~it's just a simple social call.

TRN1_INT_LI_1 = ~z~~sl:1.2:0.0~Was you followed?

TRN1_KILL_CHASE_1 = ~z~Looks like we've lost them!

TRN1_KILL_CHASE_2 = ~z~For now, maybe!

TRN1_LAG_DUTCH_01 = ~z~Arthur, come on!

TRN1_LEAVECOVER_02 = ~z~What are you doing? Get back.

TRN1_LEAVECOVER_03 = ~z~Arthur! You're going to blow our cover!

TRN1_MCS1_1 = ~z~I wanna thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Cornwall.

TRN1_MCS1_2 = ~z~This was a business meeting, Mr. Milton.

TRN1_MCS1_3 = ~z~We are not friends.

TRN1_MCS1_4 = ~z~I have spent a considerable fortune with your agency...

TRN1_MCS1_5 = ~z~and still, nothing.

TRN1_MCS1_6 = ~z~This Van der Linde robs me, and laughs at me.

TRN1_MCS1_7 = ~z~I asked for the best. I paid for the best.

TRN1_MCS1_8 = ~z~We are very close, Mr. Cornwall.

TRN1_MCS1_9 = ~z~I know you've heard this before...

TRN1_MCS1_10 = ~z~Janson.~n~~m~Sir.

TRN1_MCS1_11 = ~z~Send a telegram to Goldberg in New York...

TRN1_MCS1_12 = ~z~tell him I won't borrow at more than three point two percent.

TRN1_MCS1_13 = ~z~Sorry, no. I have heard it before...

TRN1_MCS1_14 = ~z~and get that army man to pay his portage charge.

TRN1_MCS1_15 = ~z~Yes, sir.

TRN1_MCS1_16 = ~z~We are doing all we can within the confines of the law.

TRN1_MCS1_17 = ~z~The law?

TRN1_MCS1_18 = ~z~I think we both know what you can do with your laws.

TRN1_MCS1_19 = ~z~Find me Dutch van der Linde!

TRN1_MCS1_20 = ~z~Bring him here, and leave the laws to them as need them!

TRN1_MCS1_21 = ~z~Good day, sir!

TRN1_MCS1_22 = ~z~Come along, Mr. Ross. We have work to do.

TRN1_MCS1_23 = ~z~Mr. Didsbury...

TRN1_MCS1_24 = ~z~Mr. Cornwall.

TRN1_MCS1_25 = ~z~Now, listen up, Didsbury.

TRN1_MCS1_26 = ~z~What's all this about strikes?

TRN1_MCS1_27 = ~z~I bought into this mine because of mismanagement...

TRN1_MCS1_28 = ~z~and I intend to make it a success, no matter what the cost.

TRN1_MCS1_29 = ~z~It's the wages. Folk feel...

TRN1_MCS1_30 = ~z~Folk feel?

TRN1_MCS1_31 = ~z~Business doesn't give two figs about feelings, sir.

TRN1_MCS1_32 = ~z~Not two figs.

TRN1_MCS1_33 = ~z~It's a nonsense that will bring a plague on both our houses...

TRN1_MCS1_34 = ~z~Perhaps there is a plague on your house already, Mr. Cornwall.

TRN1_MCS1_35 = ~z~What do you want, sir?

TRN1_MCS1_36 = ~z~I'm not quite sure, just yet.

TRN1_MCS1_37 = ~z~Your impudence will be your undoing, sir.

TRN1_MCS1_38 = ~z~I'm undone already.

TRN1_MCS1_39 = ~z~Even my best friend here, he thinks I'm crazy...

TRN1_MCS1_40 = ~z~and like this poor fellow you are talking to...

TRN1_MCS1_41 = ~z~my feelings are hurt.

TRN1_MCS1_42 = ~z~You robbed me, sir.

TRN1_MCS1_43 = ~z~And you robbed him. Funny world.

TRN1_MCS1_44 = ~z~You show a criminals' grasp of sophistry, sir.

TRN1_MCS1_45 = ~z~I did no such thing.

TRN1_MCS1_46 = ~z~You kill, I kill. You rob, I rob...

TRN1_MCS1_47 = ~z~only difference I can see is I choose...

TRN1_MCS1_48 = ~z~whom I kill and rob...

TRN1_MCS1_49 = ~z~and you destroy everything in your path.

TRN1_MCS1_50 = ~z~I've heard just about enough.

TRN1_MCS1_51 = ~z~I'll tell you what.

TRN1_MCS1_52 = ~z~You give me this ship, ten thousand dollars and...

TRN1_MCS1_53 = ~z~safe passage out of here. I'll let you live.

TRN1_MCS1_54 = ~z~I'll do no such thing.

TRN1_MCS1_55 = ~z~You sure?

TRN1_MCS1_56 = ~z~Good, I prefer it this way.

TRN1_MCS1_57 = ~z~You've lost your mind.

TRN1_MCS1_58 = ~z~Noise, Arthur! Noise!

TRN1_MCS2_1 = ~z~Let's go.

TRN1_MCS2_2 = ~z~Well, at least we tried talking it out.

TRN1_MCS2_3 = ~z~You boys have lost your minds.

TRN1_MCS2_4 = ~z~Oh... I felt a lot of guilt in this life, Arthur.

TRN1_MCS2_5 = ~z~I've killed too often and poorly...

TRN1_MCS2_6 = ~z~but not this time, son.

TRN1_MCS2_7 = ~z~Come on!

TRN1_MICAHBANT1_1 = ~z~You sure you got the lungs for this, Morgan?

TRN1_MICAHBANT2_2 = ~z~Did you put Dutch up to this?

TRN1_MICAHBANT2_3 = ~z~Me? I just follow orders, Morgan!

TRN1_NOCOVER_01 = ~z~Arthur, I said get yourself hidden.

TRN1_NOCOVER_02 = ~z~Will you get out of sight?

TRN1_NOCOVER_03 = ~z~Arthur, get behind something before you're spotted.

TRN1_OBJ1B_1 = ~z~Let's get down here behind these crates.

TRN1_OBJ1B_NGHT_1 = ~z~We'll wait it out here.

TRN1_OBJ1B_NGHT_2 = ~z~Get down behind these crates so no one sees us.

TRN1_OBJ2B_UP_1 = ~z~Look out up there, on the left!

TRN1_OBJ2C_1 = ~z~Come on, this way! Up the stairs!

TRN1_OBJ3_1 = ~z~Cornwall's men are all over the place.

TRN1_OBJ3_2 = ~z~Follow me, and stay close.

TRN1_OBJ5_1 = ~z~Let's go, let's go!

TRN1_OBJ6_1 = ~z~More up top here!

TRN1_OBJ6_2 = ~z~Gun them down and let's get the hell out of this place!

TRN1_OBJ7_1 = ~z~Shoot that oil wagon!

TRN1_OBJ8_1 = ~z~Alright, let's head for the hills, boys!
