MPGUN1_MCS1_17 = ~z~I can't go and kill a man in cold blood, Lee.

MPGUN1_MCS1_18 = ~z~Not while I don't have the evidence I need.

MPGUN1_MCS1_19 = ~z~But, I can turn a good old fashioned blind eye...

MPGUN1_MCS1_20 = ~z~to an unfortunate dispute that...

MPGUN1_MCS1_21 = ~z~I did not see and results in the death of some undesirables.

MPGUN1_MCS1_22 = ~z~The cause of which is unknown to me and other authorities...

MPGUN1_MCS1_23 = ~z~is that clear?

MPGUN1_MCS1_24 = ~z~Nope, not remotely.
