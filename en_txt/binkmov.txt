BKWMOV_1 = ~z~Welcome one and all to the remarkable example of modern entertainment at its finest.

BKWMOV_2 = ~z~Now most of you young'uns I'm sure know about our great national hero and pioneer Josiah Blackwater.

BKWMOV_3 = ~z~Him that gave the town of Blackwater its nomenclature.

BKWMOV_4 = ~z~You see, only about a hundred years ago,

BKWMOV_5 = ~z~were it nothing here but big old forests...

BKWMOV_6 = ~z~Ferocious beasts...

BKWMOV_7 = ~z~Surly savages...

BKWMOV_8 = ~z~Arid deserts and unconquered mountains.

BKWMOV_9 = ~z~The west, well the whole west was untamed.

BKWMOV_10 = ~z~Your momma probably told you bed time stories about Josiah's many adventures.

BKWMOV_11 = ~z~But I'm a going to tell you a story you aren't like to have heard...

BKWMOV_12 = ~z~About his possum hat.

BKWMOV_13 = ~z~Josiah Blackwater was born in the year of our lord Seventeen-Eighty-Two in a log cabin just west of Annesburg.

BKWMOV_14 = ~z~He was a special boy.

BKWMOV_15 = ~z~His pa gave him his first rifle when he was three years old.

BKWMOV_16 = ~z~Boy, he took to it right away.

BKWMOV_17 = ~z~He exclaimed...

BKWMOV_18 = ~z~“There's a whole load of critters out there in them woods, they're able to eat us.”

BKWMOV_19 = ~z~“So I'm gonna consume 'em first.”

BKWMOV_20 = ~z~Yes sir, he really took to killing all manner of things.

BKWMOV_21 = ~z~He was such a keen shot.

BKWMOV_22 = ~z~One morning, he was sorting up some winter turnips for the root seller when,

BKWMOV_23 = ~z~a big old bear and her cubs came in the kitchen hunting for food.

BKWMOV_24 = ~z~It had a mind to eat up all the jams and preserves.

BKWMOV_25 = ~z~Josiah grabbed that bear and wrestled her to the ground and squeezed and squeezed and squeezed...

BKWMOV_26 = ~z~He whooped the tar clean out of that big old critter.

BKWMOV_27 = ~z~Then he tied her up,

BKWMOV_28 = ~z~and grabbed them cubs,

BKWMOV_29 = ~z~and ground them into sausages

BKWMOV_30 = ~z~while the momma bear watched.

BKWMOV_31 = ~z~Umm, that's fine eating.

BKWMOV_32 = ~z~His ma and pa knew right then,

BKWMOV_33 = ~z~He was cut out to be the finest wild frontiersman that ever drew breath.

BKWMOV_34 = ~z~But first, they wanted him to get some book learning.

BKWMOV_35 = ~z~After only three days of attending school,

BKWMOV_36 = ~z~Josiah beat the living daylights out of the class bully and announced to his daddy

BKWMOV_37 = ~z~that he was tired of ciphering and mathematics

BKWMOV_38 = ~z~on account that's it's only good for adding up the number of critters or Indians you can kill.

BKWMOV_39 = ~z~So he ran away from home and headed west...

BKWMOV_40 = ~z~Now, these lands were occupied by savages then,

BKWMOV_41 = ~z~And when Josiah Blackwater came scouting through,

BKWMOV_42 = ~z~He recognized it to be a land of splendor,

BKWMOV_43 = ~z~wasted on those that couldn't appreciate it on account of worshiping false idols.

BKWMOV_44 = ~z~He got rid of all them pesky buffalo.

BKWMOV_45 = ~z~And thereby ensured those infernal Indians didn't have nothing to eat!

BKWMOV_46 = ~z~Of course that got them mightily riled up.

BKWMOV_47 = ~z~So he had to slaughter all them too.

BKWMOV_48 = ~z~Just like his daddy had once done to the red coats in Seventeen-Seventy-Five.

BKWMOV_49 = ~z~Right about that time,

BKWMOV_50 = ~z~he met an Indian girl he took pity on,

BKWMOV_51 = ~z~on account of having annihilated her family.

BKWMOV_52 = ~z~She was twelve years old...

BKWMOV_53 = ~z~And so he took her as his wife.

BKWMOV_54 = ~z~She gave him two sons before she died of typhus.

BKWMOV_55 = ~z~Now, you all know that Josiah Blackwater wore a possum for a hat.

BKWMOV_56 = ~z~But most don't know how that came to be...

BKWMOV_57 = ~z~One day, old Josiah was riding a couple of alligators down the Lannahechee River.

BKWMOV_58 = ~z~Riding standing up, and shooting eagles right out of the sky.

BKWMOV_59 = ~z~When he sees a big old mountain lion about to eat a possum.

BKWMOV_60 = ~z~Josiah grabbed that mountain lion by the tail and wrestled it 'till it was plum dead.

BKWMOV_61 = ~z~Well that possum really took to Josiah,

BKWMOV_62 = ~z~Followed him around like a dog loyal to its master.

BKWMOV_63 = ~z~Yes, they had a lot of adventures together.

BKWMOV_64 = ~z~Now Josiah never cried a day in his life.

BKWMOV_65 = ~z~But he pert-near did on the day that possum passed.

BKWMOV_66 = ~z~For they were mighty fine friends.

BKWMOV_67 = ~z~So he skinned it,

BKWMOV_68 = ~z~And made it in to a hat.

BKWMOV_69 = ~z~Back in them days, a possum skin was as good as money.

BKWMOV_70 = ~z~But he never parted with that hat.

BKWMOV_71 = ~z~Not even for ten dollars.

BKWMOV_72 = ~z~Once he founded the town of Blackwater,

BKWMOV_73 = ~z~he sent word for settlers to come.

BKWMOV_74 = ~z~It was the last stop in the west before San Francisco.

BKWMOV_75 = ~z~He meet a girl by the name of Ruthenia Hellsby at a barn dance one night.

BKWMOV_76 = ~z~Took her as his wife and settled down.

BKWMOV_77 = ~z~Built himself a cattle empire and had fourteen young'uns.

BKWMOV_78 = ~z~But Josiah Blackwater wasn't the home loving kind,

BKWMOV_79 = ~z~And he grew mighty restless.

BKWMOV_80 = ~z~One day on the courthouse steps, he announced

BKWMOV_81 = ~z~“You may all go to hell, and I will go to Saint Denis”

BKWMOV_82 = ~z~And so he did...

BKWMOV_83 = ~z~Enjoyed French pursuits, of strumpets and wanton gluttony.

BKWMOV_84 = ~z~Which is where he came to form the idea of running for Congress.

BKWMOV_85 = ~z~He wore that possum hat every day as a congressman.

BKWMOV_86 = ~z~As a reminder of where he'd come from.

BKWMOV_87 = ~z~Saying “I may live in barbaric splendor, but I always remember...

BKWMOV_88 = ~z~Keep your friends close, and your gun closer...

BKWMOV_89 = ~z~'cause you don't know when you might have to shoot 'em“

BSYMOV_1 = ~z~Folks, I'm gonna tell you a morality tale from when our country was young,

BSYMOV_2 = ~z~that the settlers used to tell about the woods of Massachusetts and the creatures that lived there.

BSYMOV_3 = ~z~One summer, Bear was by the stream and Old Man Wind appeared and said

BSYMOV_4 = ~z~“Bear, I shall blow a mighty cold upon the land, and gorge yourself on fish and meat and go find a den.

BSYMOV_5 = ~z~Then sleep. Not for one night, but for sixty. Go tell all the animals of the forest what I have told you.”

BSYMOV_6 = ~z~Bear was sad because the fish were his friends, and now...

BSYMOV_7 = ~z~He had to eat them...

BSYMOV_8 = ~z~But he knew to do whatever the wind told him.

BSYMOV_9 = ~z~The animals of the forest often teased Bear, and said he was slow and lazy and foolish for listening to Old Man Wind.

BSYMOV_10 = ~z~“You talking to the wind again, hey?” laughed the Rabbit.

BSYMOV_11 = ~z~“I think Bear has finally taken leave of his senses.” said the Turtle.

BSYMOV_12 = ~z~“And he's getting so rotund that even I could outrun him”.

BSYMOV_13 = ~z~“I'm smart and quick!” said Rabbit.

BSYMOV_14 = ~z~“I'll outrun Old Man Wind if he comes crawling, or you... since you're into eating your friends.”

BSYMOV_15 = ~z~The Turtle said “If wind comes I'll just hide in my shell.”

BSYMOV_16 = ~z~Then Bear went and warned Coyote and Possum that they should prepare for a long cold winter.

BSYMOV_17 = ~z~“It's so hot” said the coyote, “there's plenty of time.”

BSYMOV_18 = ~z~The lazy possum said “There's an abundance of food, maybe I'll just store some in my pouch.”

BSYMOV_19 = ~z~Even his squirrel friends made fun of Bear.

BSYMOV_20 = ~z~They laughed, and laughed, and squibbled and squabbled.

BSYMOV_21 = ~z~“Chunky needs a nap.”

BSYMOV_22 = ~z~“Tiny goody too shoes does what he's told!”

BSYMOV_23 = ~z~Bear was very sad, but he was a good bear!

BSYMOV_24 = ~z~And he always did what Old Man Wind told him.

BSYMOV_25 = ~z~He went and found a den, snuggled inside and fell fast asleep.

BSYMOV_26 = ~z~Bear snored and snored for many days. When he woke up, he saw spring had come.

BSYMOV_27 = ~z~He was very hungry so he walked outside.

BSYMOV_28 = ~z~As the snow melted he saw all his friends who hadn't listened,

BSYMOV_29 = ~z~frozen...

BSYMOV_30 = ~z~And just ready to be eaten.

BSYMOV_31 = ~z~And that's why the bear hibernates.

BSYMOV_32 = ~z~So listen to your elders, and do just what you're told.

GSTMOV_1 = ~z~Greetings and salutations, gentle folk.

GSTMOV_2 = ~z~This here's the story about a young couple from the village of Annesburg that was courting a few years after the revolutionary war.

GSTMOV_3 = ~z~Courting in the woods.

GSTMOV_4 = ~z~As you know young people are want to do.

GSTMOV_5 = ~z~Stealing away all sneaky like.

GSTMOV_6 = ~z~A girl by the name of Ethel Boshared snuck out of the parlour one evening

GSTMOV_7 = ~z~just as soon as her mother went out to hang clothes on the line from the washing.

GSTMOV_8 = ~z~She met up on the road by her farm with a boy.

GSTMOV_9 = ~z~By the name of Eugene Hutton,

GSTMOV_10 = ~z~Now the Hutton boy was an athletic chap, liked boxing, fishing and swinging Indian clubs.

GSTMOV_11 = ~z~It's quite singular to the story that he didn't seem all that inclined to go to war in the preceding years leading up.

GSTMOV_12 = ~z~Well, they walked in the woods for a while.

GSTMOV_13 = ~z~Pretty soon they lost their bearings and no longer knew the north from the south.

GSTMOV_14 = ~z~Nor east from west, neither.

GSTMOV_15 = ~z~Then they heard a low moaning sound.

GSTMOV_16 = ~z~“What's that terrible noise?” she said all a'tremble.

GSTMOV_17 = ~z~ “Must be a sick calf looking for its momma, they've been known to bawl like that.

GSTMOV_18 = ~z~Let me take a look." said Eugene.

GSTMOV_19 = ~z~Well old Eugene went and disappeared around a tree,

GSTMOV_20 = ~z~came out the other side and gave her a terrible fright.

GSTMOV_21 = ~z~“Boo!”

GSTMOV_22 = ~z~She let out a shriek. Then went to chastising...

GSTMOV_23 = ~z~“You should be ashamed of yourself, Eugene Hutton” she said.

GSTMOV_24 = ~z~“Instead of giving a girl protection, you go carry on acting foolish and fresh, like the Queen's prize jester”

GSTMOV_25 = ~z~But right then and there, a chilly wind blew through and knocked of Eugene's hat.

GSTMOV_26 = ~z~“I need to get back home, my momma has a terrible temper,

GSTMOV_27 = ~z~She's like to stomp up and down if she finds out we're missing.”

GSTMOV_28 = ~z~"She is a fair, stout woman" Eugene noted.

GSTMOV_29 = ~z~But just then, before this couple of miscreants could head home,

GSTMOV_30 = ~z~they heard the sound of heavy wheels, groaning and people marching.

GSTMOV_31 = ~z~The cacophony grew closer and closer.

GSTMOV_32 = ~z~And through the fog, they could make out the shapes of ghost horses,

GSTMOV_33 = ~z~Pulling spectral cannons,

GSTMOV_34 = ~z~and dead soldiers,

GSTMOV_35 = ~z~marching as if their graves could no longer contain them.

GSTMOV_36 = ~z~Each wearing a vile red coat.

GSTMOV_37 = ~z~“You will pay for your moral transgressions.” a dead soldier howled.

GSTMOV_38 = ~z~And cut his head clean off.

GSTMOV_39 = ~z~Miss Boshared shrieked in horror,

GSTMOV_40 = ~z~as Eugene's head landed right in her hands.

GSTMOV_41 = ~z~His eyes still darting about attempting to discern what horror had transpired.

GSTMOV_42 = ~z~Little Miss Ethel Boshared ran as fast as she could.

GSTMOV_43 = ~z~Stumbling and getting caught on trees,

GSTMOV_44 = ~z~As she tore through the forests.

GSTMOV_45 = ~z~Terrified for her life, the dead soldiers marching after her...

GSTMOV_46 = ~z~Hungry for blood.

GSTMOV_47 = ~z~When she returned home,

GSTMOV_48 = ~z~she told the people of the village that an army of the dead had taken Eugene, with in the confines of the fog.

GSTMOV_49 = ~z~British soldiers who died protecting tyranny

GSTMOV_50 = ~z~were rising from their graves as if to continue the fight, for the demonic English.

GSTMOV_51 = ~z~The townspeople erupted in fright and dismay,

GSTMOV_52 = ~z~until one guy that came forth, and accused her of witchcraft.

GSTMOV_53 = ~z~“She raised the dead to murder that boy.

GSTMOV_54 = ~z~for his pursuit of unwanted advances.” he said.

GSTMOV_55 = ~z~“So she too must perish.”

GSTMOV_56 = ~z~And that very night, they put her to the stake and burnt her dead.

GSTMOV_57 = ~z~Now let that be a lesson to you young ones not to go courting in the woods,

GSTMOV_58 = ~z~in case the English lurk there, still!

RBCH2MOV_16 = ~z~But I'm trying very hard to be something like the man you deserve.

RBCH2MOV_17 = ~z~I have done something very silly...

RBCH2MOV_18 = ~z~In an effort to impress you.

RBCH2MOV_19 = ~z~And that is,

RBCH2MOV_20 = ~z~I've purchased a home.

RBCH2MOV_21 = ~z~The land you read about in the new paper up at Beecher's Hope,

RBCH2MOV_22 = ~z~Is now ours.

STWMOV_23 = ~z~A marvellous statue.

STWMOV_24 = ~z~To welcome all the Irish people moving to our great country,

STWMOV_25 = ~z~after all those potato problems.

STWMOV_26 = ~z~They are welcomed by tourists.

STWMOV_27 = ~z~Who toss potatoes out of the head of that lady.

STWMOV_28 = ~z~In New York City, they are making buildings so high,

STWMOV_29 = ~z~one day you can walk to the moon for a picnic.

STWMOV_30 = ~z~Wouldn't that be grand?

STWMOV_31 = ~z~It's true!

STWMOV_32 = ~z~Now, we spoke of that unwashed statue.

STWMOV_33 = ~z~It was a gift from France.

STWMOV_34 = ~z~How do you think France paid for such a gift?

STWMOV_35 = ~z~Wanton prostitution?

STWMOV_36 = ~z~Selling of wine and horse meat?

STWMOV_37 = ~z~No sir!

STWMOV_38 = ~z~I'm here to tell you, that underneath the streets of Paris,

STWMOV_39 = ~z~they have discovered, black gold!

STWMOV_40 = ~z~That's right, and a few year ago, Gustave Eiffel

STWMOV_41 = ~z~of the Eiffel Oil Company built the tallest oil derrick in the world!

STWMOV_42 = ~z~Yes...

STWMOV_43 = ~z~All around Paris, you will find that thick business,

STWMOV_44 = ~z~it ignites like brandy

STWMOV_45 = ~z~which is why so many French aristocrats drink it as an aperitif to aid digestion.

STWMOV_46 = ~z~The women of France are dainty and fair of skin, partly because they use that crude oil to bath in.

STWMOV_60 = ~z~You may have heard talk of a horseless carriage being invented.

STWMOV_61 = ~z~Powered by whale oil, vapours or demons!

STWMOV_62 = ~z~Ironically, that is a myth!

STWMOV_63 = ~z~What is more exciting, the Germans have developed a mechanized horse

STWMOV_64 = ~z~that never needs to eat or sleep!

STWMOV_65 = ~z~It is a marvel of invention,

STWMOV_66 = ~z~and is intended to facility the German army when it invades France or Russia,

STWMOV_67 = ~z~in their campaign to spread the gastronomical wonders of

STWMOV_68 = ~z~low quality beer, sausages and sauerkraut.

STWMOV_69 = ~z~They love cabbage.

STWMOV_70 = ~z~But other than America, where we have plenty of room.

STWMOV_71 = ~z~It is so crowded in Europe that they are racing to setup a new country at the North Pole

STWMOV_72 = ~z~where they can dine on the delicacy of frozen fish, penguins and polar bears.

STWMOV_73 = ~z~Imagine, a place that never gets hot!

STWMOV_74 = ~z~You don't sweat while toiling in the field.

STWMOV_75 = ~z~And ice is much cheaper there!

STWMOV_76 = ~z~I predict that someday people of all nations

STWMOV_77 = ~z~will join hands at the North Pole,

STWMOV_78 = ~z~wearing furs and eating fish!

STWMOV_79 = ~z~My next adventure will be to visit Egypt,

STWMOV_80 = ~z~where I hear they live in giant triangles,

STWMOV_81 = ~z~and talk in a Chinese like language of

STWMOV_82 = ~z~birds, and eyes, squiggly lines.

STWMOV_83 = ~z~And they worship cats

STWMOV_84 = ~z~which is a bit worrisome and unsavoury.
