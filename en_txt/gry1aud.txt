GRY1_1MORE_02 = ~z~Should just be one more, Arthur.

GRY1_BACK_1 = ~z~How does it feel, being a fine upholder of the law?

GRY1_BACK_2 = ~z~Not that different to our normal lives so far. Who were those fellers?

GRY1_BACK_3 = ~z~Not sure. Probably the people they was selling to. Guess we can't ask 'em now.

GRY1_BACK_4 = ~z~And I thought I was protective over my liquor.

GRY1_BANT1A_1 = ~z~Archibald.

GRY1_BANT1A_2 = ~z~How are you?

GRY1_BANT1A_3 = ~z~Pretty good.

GRY1_BANT1A_4 = ~z~And your friend is behaving himself?

GRY1_BANT1A_5 = ~z~Oh... yes, I-I think he's learned his lesson.

GRY1_BANT1A_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Congratulations on becoming a temporarily deputized...~sl:~citizen of Scarlett Meadows County.

GRY1_BANT1A_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Most towns just get bounty hunters to do their dirty work these days,~sl:0.0:3.1~but ~rp~Sheriff Gray believes the Law should keep the law.~lr:0.3~Now, I'm sure I don't need to remind you there's a chain of command here.

GRY1_BANT1A_8 = ~z~There is?

GRY1_BANT1A_9 = ~z~Dang straight there is.

GRY1_BANT1A_10 = ~z~This is a dangerous business, but follow my lead and you'll be just fine.

GRY1_BANT1A_11 = ~z~Sure.

GRY1_BANT1A_12 = ~z~Hey, Archibald wants to remind us he's in charge here.

GRY1_BANT1A_13 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.6:1~Of course.

GRY1_BANT1A_14 = ~z~~sl:0.1~Who else would be?

GRY1_BANT1A_15 = ~z~You were a big help with them Anderson boys and I...

GRY1_BANT1A_16 = ~z~put in a very good word with the sheriff on your behalf.

GRY1_BANT1A_17 = ~z~We appreciate that.

GRY1_BANT1A_18 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~We rounded up the others soon after.~lr:~I'm pushing for the rope myself, but that's by the by.

GRY1_BANT1A_19 = ~z~So, these moonshiners...

GRY1_BANT1A_20 = ~z~Not just any moonshiners. Braithwaites.

GRY1_BANT1A_21 = ~z~I told you about the Braithwaites?

GRY1_BANT1A_22 = ~z~Pretty sure you did.

GRY1_BANT1A_23 = ~z~Old cotton family, ~rp~had a fortune at one point until...

GRY1_BANT1A_24 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~well, ~rp~a few changes in the labor laws.~lr:0.2~Now they're dealing in moonshine.

GRY1_BANT1A_25 = ~z~We've found their stills hidden all over Lemoyne.

GRY1_BANT1A_26 = ~z~Quick as we destroy one, another one pops up.

GRY1_BANT1A_27 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~You could call it a pitiful fall from grace,~sl:0.1~if they had any grace to start with.

GRY1_BANT1A_28 = ~z~I have no time for tax dodgers.

GRY1_BANT1A_29 = ~z~Not to mention the fact that Catherine Braithwaite has a rather...

GRY1_BANT1A_30 = ~z~expensive interest in thoroughbred horses to maintain.

GRY1_BANT1A_31 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~But, ~rp~I heard something about it being gold...~sl:~these families were fighting over.

GRY1_BANT1A_32 = ~z~Well, that's the rumor...

GRY1_BANT1A_33 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~but the Grays and the Braithwaites...~sl:~think the other stole a fortune from them...

GRY1_BANT1A_34 = ~z~but ~rp~it happened so long ago, I don't know for sure if it's true.

GRY1_BANT1A_35 = ~z~Must be tough being rich, huh?

GRY1_BANT1A_36 = ~z~~sl:1.0~So I imagine.

GRY1_BANT1B_NO_1 = ~z~Sure sounds like you fellers got your work cut out for you round here.

GRY1_BANT1B_P1_1 = ~z~Okay... Fredrick Mitchell, Lemoyne state legislator. Poor feller.

GRY1_BANT1B_P1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Yes, this certainly smacks of the Raiders to me.~lr:~Bunch of ex-army free-staters without an ounce of respect for the law.

GRY1_BANT1B_P1_3 = ~z~That's seven government officials they've murdered this year alone.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.3~And I know the Braithwaites are in business with them. No shame.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_2 = ~z~Trash begets trash, my Uncle Reginald used to say.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_3 = ~z~He had a few stories, let me tell you. Town preacher and town sheriff.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_4 = ~z~Could drink a sailor under the table before breakfast.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_5 = ~z~He had one tiny hand, like a child's on the end of a grown man's arm...

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~But anyway, this tells you what kind of people the Braithwaites are...~sl:~selling moonshine to murderers.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_7 = ~z~I tell folks, don't even speak to 'em, don't even look 'em in the eye.

GRY1_BANT1B_P2_8 = ~z~I'm sure I wouldn't.

GRY1_BANT1B_YES_1 = ~z~Yep, not the nicest fellers in my experience.

GRY1_BILLGET_01 = ~z~My turn.

GRY1_BILLGET_02 = ~z~I got this one.

GRY1_BILLGO_1 = ~z~Reckon one or two sticks should do it. I'll deal with the other stills.

GRY1_BILLGO_2 = ~z~As you were, Private Williamson.

GRY1_BILLGO_3 = ~z~Shut up.

GRY1_BILLHELP_01 = ~z~Shit! We got men over here!

GRY1_BILLHELP_02 = ~z~Arthur, we got some trouble here!

GRY1_BILL_BK_1 = ~z~Alright, I'll see you over there.

GRY1_BILL_STAY_1 = ~z~You wait here. I'll deal with him.

GRY1_BILL_STAY_2 = ~z~Ok, make it quick.

GRY1_BILL_WORKR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7:1~Come here.

GRY1_BRIDGE_01 = ~z~Shit, he's coming back. Get under the bridge.

GRY1_BRIDGE_02 = ~z~He's turned around. Quick, under here.

GRY1_CLEAR_1 = ~z~I don't see any more, do you?

GRY1_CLEAR_2 = ~z~No.

GRY1_CLEAR_3 = ~z~Let's find Dutch and get out of here.

GRY1_CLEAR_4 = ~z~Fine by me.

GRY1_COMING_01 = ~z~Damn... Someone's coming. Stay out of sight.

GRY1_COMING_02 = ~z~Quick, hide. Another one coming this way...

GRY1_DAWD_01 = ~z~Go on.

GRY1_DAWD_02 = ~z~Quick, Morgan.

GRY1_DAWD_03 = ~z~What are you waiting for?

GRY1_DB_BANT1_1 = ~z~That badge rather suits you, Mr. W.

GRY1_DB_BANT1_2 = ~z~Yes, I thought so too.

GRY1_DB_BANT1_3 = ~z~Does it feel good to be back at it, serving your country?

GRY1_DB_BANT1_4 = ~z~I wouldn't go that far.

GRY1_DB_BANT2_1 = ~z~These damn flies, I swear they've got it in for me.

GRY1_DB_BANT2_2 = ~z~You could try washing once in a while.

GRY1_DB_BANT3_1 = ~z~Dangerous business the life of a lawman, isn't it?

GRY1_DB_BANT3_2 = ~z~Appears so.

GRY1_DB_BANT3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4:1~I'm just glad we got Archibald here to show us the ropes.

GRY1_DEPUTY_1 = ~z~Arthur, you ride with the deputy. Bill and I will follow.

GRY1_DIRECT2_1 = ~z~Bear right again here.

GRY1_DIRECT_1 = ~z~Go right at the crossroads.

GRY1_DROPW_01 = ~z~Just drop him with the others.

GRY1_DROPW_02 = ~z~Add him to the pile, Arthur.

GRY1_DROP_01 = ~z~Now would be good.

GRY1_DROP_02 = ~z~Go on, put him down.

GRY1_EXT2_1 = ~z~I never knew you were quite so good...

GRY1_EXT2_2 = ~z~at running away, Arthur.

GRY1_EXT2_3 = ~z~Well, I never knew age...

GRY1_EXT2_4 = ~z~had slowed you down quite so much.

GRY1_EXT2_5 = ~z~Well, time is a bastard.

GRY1_EXT2_6 = ~z~When you get to be my age...

GRY1_EXT2_7 = ~z~well, you'll know that better than anything.

GRY1_EXT2_8 = ~z~Be well.

GRY1_EXT2_9 = ~z~I had fun with you today.

GRY1_EXT2_10 = ~z~You're...

GRY1_EXT2_11 = ~z~I was gonna say you're like a son to me...

GRY1_EXT2_12 = ~z~but you're more than that.

GRY1_EXT2_13 = ~z~Oh, I am sorry, son.

GRY1_EXT2_14 = ~z~Spare the gloating, Dutch.

GRY1_EXT2_15 = ~z~Oh, I'm not a gloater.

GRY1_EXT2_16 = ~z~Why would I laugh at the fact that you haven't learned...

GRY1_EXT2_17 = ~z~after all these years to ride a horse very well?

GRY1_EXT2_18 = ~z~That is a source of great sorrow to me.

GRY1_EXT2_19 = ~z~Very funny.

GRY1_EXT2_20 = ~z~I had fun with you today.

GRY1_EXT2_21 = ~z~Be well.

GRY1_EXT2_22 = ~z~You're...

GRY1_EXT2_23 = ~z~well...

GRY1_EXT2_24 = ~z~I was gonna say you're like a son to me...

GRY1_EXT2_25 = ~z~but you're more than that.

GRY1_EXT_1 = ~z~Well done.

GRY1_EXT_2 = ~z~Well, forgive me...

GRY1_EXT_3 = ~z~but, me and my men...

GRY1_EXT_4 = ~z~must return to our lives.

GRY1_EXT_5 = ~z~but, me and my men...

GRY1_EXT_6 = ~z~must return to our lives.

GRY1_EXT_7 = ~z~Ah...

GRY1_EXT_8 = ~z~seems like we failed to destroy...

GRY1_EXT_9 = ~z~the last of the moonshine.

GRY1_EXT_10 = ~z~Sure...

GRY1_EXT_11 = ~z~Would you like us to?

GRY1_EXT_12 = ~z~Well, I normally take it for personal consumption...

GRY1_EXT_13 = ~z~it's sorta part of the job.

GRY1_EXT_14 = ~z~But, I better get back home.

GRY1_EXT_15 = ~z~Why don't I just take a jug or two...

GRY1_EXT_16 = ~z~and leave you boys the rest...

GRY1_EXT_17 = ~z~to show that there's no hard feelings...

GRY1_EXT_18 = ~z~on account of the war.

GRY1_EXT_19 = ~z~We are all Americans.

GRY1_EXT_20 = ~z~Of course.

GRY1_EXT_21 = ~z~My cousin...

GRY1_EXT_22 = ~z~Webster...

GRY1_EXT_23 = ~z~he used to say...

GRY1_EXT_24 = ~z~“Some of us is not as American as others."

GRY1_EXT_25 = ~z~If you know what I mean...

GRY1_EXT_26 = ~z~only I didn't quite.

GRY1_EXT_27 = ~z~Come on you degenerate...

GRY1_EXT_28 = ~z~no good, white trash...

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_1 = ~z~Bit of trouble back there, Arthur?

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_3 = ~z~Old Archibald didn't ask too many questions so neither should we.

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_4 = ~z~I ain't planning to.

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_5 = ~z~That was worth the effort, though. Deputized and hiding in plain sight.

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_7 = ~z~It's got Hosea written all over it.

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_8 = ~z~This is starting to sound like the young Dutch again.

GRY1_EXT_BANT2_10 = ~z~Hey, you know what... why don't I race you back?

GRY1_EXT_BANT_1 = ~z~Should I stash this somewhere near camp, boss?

GRY1_IG1_B_2 = ~z~A thousand acres or more, three hundred slaves... and well,

GRY1_IG1_B_3 = ~z~decadence crept into their way of living, decadence and debauchery.

GRY1_IG1_B_4 = ~z~Kind of like in England, which is why they cut the king's head off?

GRY1_IG1_B_5 = ~z~And at the same time, the Gray family came from Scotland, recently ah... maybe a hundred and twenty years ago.

GRY1_IG1_B_6 = ~z~And they challenged the Braithwaites... and, over time, a feud developed.

GRY1_IG1_B_7 = ~z~With the Grays being right and proper in pretty much everything, and the Braithwaites being uncivilized...

GRY1_IG1_B_11 = ~z~Sure...

GRY1_IG1_B_12 = ~z~Just a second.

GRY1_IG1_P1B_1 = ~z~Now, anyone we find here, we bring in alive, understood?

GRY1_IG1_P1B_2 = ~z~Round them up, then take this operation down for good.

GRY1_IG1_P1B_3 = ~z~Come on, let's see what we're dealing with.

GRY1_IG1_P1_1 = ~z~Here we are... so what was I saying?

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_5 = ~z~No, the one who joined the army.

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_6 = ~z~Oh yeah... that feller.

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_7 = ~z~Oh, he thought he was going to get sent to jail?

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_8 = ~z~So he joined the army, and then they sent him overseas, to the Philippines.

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_9 = ~z~Where the hell is that?

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_10 = ~z~I don't know. Europe I guess... oh, he used to hate being sent to other countries.

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_11 = ~z~Then he'll hate going to Europe like that.

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~I know.~sl:0.6~... I never liked that guy.

GRY1_IG3_CHAT_13 = ~z~To be honest, neither did I...

GRY1_IG15_LCO3_1 = ~z~Don't dwell on it, let's just move on.

GRY1_IG15_LEAVE_1 = ~z~Let's see if we've got any identification.

GRY1_IG15_LEAVE_2 = ~z~Okay, we should get going.

GRY1_IG15_LEAVE_3 = ~z~I'll send someone over here later to clean this up.

GRY1_IG15_PICK_1 = ~z~I think that's it.

GRY1_IG15_PICK_2 = ~z~Well, what do we do now?

GRY1_IG15_PICK_3 = ~z~We better destroy all this.
