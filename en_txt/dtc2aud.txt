DCH2_RSC1_13 = ~z~They took him to scare us.

DCH2_RSC1_14 = ~z~Nobody takes a boy to harm him.

DCH2_RSC1_15 = ~z~He's right, John.

DCH2_RSC1_16 = ~z~What do you think, Arthur?

DCH2_RSC1_17 = ~z~The boy'll be fine, but...

DCH2_RSC1_18 = ~z~of course Marston's scared rotten.

DCH2_RSC1_19 = ~z~We killed all those people...

DCH2_RSC1_20 = ~z~we stirred up all that trouble...

DCH2_RSC1_21 = ~z~for nothing.

DCH2_RSC1_22 = ~z~No, no, not for nothing.
