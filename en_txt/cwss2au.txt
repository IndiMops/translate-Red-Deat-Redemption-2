CWSS2_ACTION_1 = ~z~Oh, Mr. Morgan... I had your stuff unloaded.

CWSS2_ACTION_2 = ~z~Thank you.

CWSS2_ACTION_3 = ~z~I put you in one of the upstairs bedrooms, I thought that would be a little nicer for you...

CWSS2_ACTION_4 = ~z~I mean, the place is dump, but... we can survive here.

CWSS2_ACTION_5 = ~z~Yes... it's, uh... it's great if you love alligators and mosquitoes.

CWSS2_ACTION_6 = ~z~Exactly. Anyway, it's left at the top of the stairs and head on to the end of the landing.

CWSS2_ACTION_7 = ~z~Thank you.
