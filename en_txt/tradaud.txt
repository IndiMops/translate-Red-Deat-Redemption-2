TRAD_INT_28 = ~z~Me losing interest in the whole idea.

TRAD_INT_29 = ~z~But, if we combine our talents, we'll be unstoppable.

TRAD_INT_30 = ~z~Now, I will require an initial modest investment of course.

TRAD_INT_31 = ~z~Start-up costs and suchlike, but you'll recoup that as fast as you can say...

TRAD_INT_32 = ~z~“Cripps, you handsome genius”.

TRAD_INT_33 = ~z~So, how about it?

TRAD_INT_34 = ~z~Are you in?

TRAD_INT_35 = ~z~My talents extend far beyond the harmonica, I can assure you.

TRAD_INT_36 = ~z~Now, you don't have to pay me right now of course...

TRAD_INT_37 = ~z~but the sooner we're up and running the better.

TRAD_INT_38 = ~z~I mean...

TRAD_INT_39 = ~z~I might be looking at the next Leviticus Cornwall here.

TRAD_INT_40 = ~z~Good.

TRAD_INT_41 = ~z~You won't regret this, I promise.

TRAD_INT_42 = ~z~Now, I've already got hold of a small wagon...

TRAD_INT_43 = ~z~and most of what we'll need in terms of initial supplies.

TRAD_INT_44 = ~z~If you can grab that and bring it back to camp...

TRAD_INT_45 = ~z~we'll get everything set up.

TRAD_INT_46 = ~z~This is gonna be fun.

TRAD_INT_47 = ~z~Come on.

TRAD_INT_48 = ~z~Alright, you'll know where to find me if you change your mind.

TRAD_INT_49 = ~z~When you change your mind, I should say.

TRAD_INT_50 = ~z~You'll kick yourself if you miss out on this.

TRAD_INT_51 = ~z~Oh, I forgot.

TRAD_INT_52 = ~z~Not much in the coffers right now is there?

TRAD_INT_53 = ~z~No problem to pay me later.

TRAD_INT_54 = ~z~You know where to find me.

TRAD_INT_FAIL1_1 = ~z~So, er, what's happening with this wagon of supplies? You're as slow as a cow in a bog hole.

TRAD_INT_FAIL1_2 = ~z~I can't do nothing without that stuff. Please, it shouldn't take you too long...

TRAD_INT_FAIL1_3 = ~z~it'd be nice to get this business going some time this century if we can...

TRAD_INT_FAIL2_1 = ~z~See, I'm looking at the blank expression on your face,

TRAD_INT_FAIL2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~and I get a sinking feeling you've forgotten all about~sl:~the wagon of supplies you were supposed to collect for me.

TRAD_INT_FAIL2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Now, I know that can't possibly be true, but...~sl:0.0:3.0~make an old man happy and go fetch it,~sl:~will you please?

TRAD_INT_FAIL3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~So, Cripps Trading Company... remember that whole~sl:~brainwave to make us both rich?

TRAD_INT_FAIL3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well, I'm still waiting for that wagon of supplies.~sl:~What's taking so long?

TRAD_INT_FAIL3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~You're as useless as teats on a boar...~sl:~although, teats seem fairly essential for a boar...

TRAD_INT_FAIL3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Anyway, sooner you fetch that wagon,~sl:~sooner we can get up and running.

TRAD_JB_RE_STRN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~If there's one thing I learned from my Pa,~sl:~it's that honest work will only get you so far.

TRAD_JB_RE_STRN_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~So, I heard about some supplies on a train coming this way~sl:0.0:1.7~that could be very useful to us...~sl:0.3~and free, so to speak, for the right opportunist.

TRAD_JB_RE_STRN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~I think I can leave the rest in your capable hands, don't you?~sl:~Just watch yourself.

TRAD_JB_RS_CHEM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~This is such delicate work. Part artist, part scientist.~sl:~A complex marriage, like they all are.

TRAD_JB_RS_CHEM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Anyway, there's some chemicals I need~sl:~to help with the tanning and preservation process.

TRAD_JB_RS_CHEM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~Can you track down some more for me?~sl:~Quite volatile stuff, so be careful with it.

TRAD_JB_RS_CP1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I'm a one-man sweatshop here.~sl:0.0:2.6~Already ran out of tanning and cleaning supplies...~sl:~reckon you can pick some more up for me?

TRAD_JB_RS_CP1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I bet you didn't think old Cripps had it in him, did ya?~sl:~From camp dogsbody to artisanal entrepreneur...

TRAD_MS_COLLCT1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Oh, there you are. I sent you a note... just some details of~sl:~a few potentially lucrative possibilities.

TRAD_MS_COLLCT2_01 = ~z~Did you pick up my letter yet? I think you'll find it interesting.

TRAD_MS_COLLCT2_02 = ~z~Did you get my note? It could be worth your while.

TRAD_MS_COLLCT2_03 = ~z~Don't forget to pick up that note I sent you.

TRAD_MS_INTFAIL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~I still need that wagon of supplies~sl:~to get the business up and running.

TRAD_MS_INTFAIL_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Don't forget about the wagon of supplies.~sl:~I need that before we can get set up.

TRAD_MS_INTFAIL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Don't leave that wagon of supplies out there for too long~sl:~or someone'll nab them.

TRAD_MS_INTNPC_01 = ~z~You changed your mind? Good.

TRAD_MS_INTNPC_02 = ~z~I knew you'd come around.

TRAD_MS_INTNPC_03 = ~z~You won't regret it.

TRAD_MS_INTNP_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Just let me know if you're interested~sl:~in starting up that business.

TRAD_MS_INTNP_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Don't forget about that business opportunity.~sl:~You'll kick yourself if you miss out.

TRAD_MS_INTNP_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Don't forget... just need a small investment~sl:~and we can get that business up and running.

TRAD_MS_TAKEPRT_01 = ~z~Had any luck with those supply trains yet?

TRAD_MS_TAKEPRT_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Have you had a chance to look into those~sl:~supply trains I wrote to you about?

TRAD_MS_TAKEPRT_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~Keep an eye out for those~sl:~supply trains coming through, okay?

TRAD_RE_BRDW1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~You know I like to keep my ear to the ground,~sl:~and not just when I'm passed out in the dirt.

TRAD_RE_BRDW1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Well, I heard some other traders might have broken down~sl:~on a delivery run and I'd hate for them to get robbed out there...

TRAD_RE_BRDW1_3 = ~z~but I mean, these things happen, right?

TRAD_RE_BRDW2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~You know how I like to keep a close eye on~sl:0.0:2.2~the competition... well, some other traders are apparently~sl:~having some wagon difficulties.

TRAD_RE_BRDW2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Sitting ducks out there, by all accounts.~sl:0.1:~So, I mean, better we rob them than somebody else, right?

TRAD_RE_BRDW2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~"Cripps Law, page seventeen:~sl:0.0~Always keep your friends close and screw over your rivals."

TRAD_RE_BRDW3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Okay, don't ask me how I know this, but~sl:~some of our fellow traders are having some transportation difficulties.

TRAD_RE_BRDW3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Stranded, at the mercy of brigands and outlaws.~sl:0.0:3.0~So we can play nice or we can play smart.~sl:0.3~And you aren't very good at playing nice.

TRAD_RE_CHEM2_1 = ~z~You know the chemicals I use for the tanning... after a few hours, the effects are rather pleasant.

TRAD_RE_CHEM2_2 = ~z~Definitely a perk of the trade. Anyway, I seem to be going through it at quite a rate.

TRAD_RE_CHEM2_3 = ~z~Could you track down some more for me? Just make sure you ride careful with it.

TRAD_RE_CHEM3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~I was hoping you could source some more tanning fluid~sl:0.0:2.3~for me? I'm getting pretty damn good with the stuff,~sl:~I have to admit.

TRAD_RE_CHEM3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~In general, I'd say old drunks and explosive chemicals are~sl:0.0:3.4:1~not a good mix... but I seem to be the exception to that rule.

TRAD_RE_CHEM3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Anyway, I'm sure I don't need to tell you to be~sl:~careful with the stuff. Travel slow with it.

TRAD_RE_CP1_2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Before you say anything, I ain't taking a break.~sl:0.0:2.7~I'm just out of cleaning and tanning supplies so~sl:~I can't do too much more right now.

TRAD_RE_CP1_2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Say, could you, uh, go pick up some more for me?~sl:0.0:2.4~Oh, and best skip the rubbing alcohol this time...~sl:0.9~that turned into a bad night.

TRAD_RE_CP2_1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.5:2.0~Hard keeping up with me, ain't it?~sl:0.0:2.7~My second wife used to say the same thing...~sl:0.3~or maybe that was “putting up with me”?

TRAD_RE_CP2_1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.2:1.9~I don't remember too much of the 40's.~sl:~Anyway, I'm already out of supplies again.

TRAD_RE_CP2_1_3 = ~z~Can you track down some more for me? Much appreciated.

TRAD_RE_CP2_3_1 = ~z~You know, my pa used to say “a cat doesn't make a good dog”.

TRAD_RE_CP2_3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I never really knew what he meant by that, but...~sl:0.1~I feel like I finally found my calling.

TRAD_RE_CP2_3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~We're doing well, very well.~sl:0.0:3.5~Just at a standstill till I get some more tanning supplies.~sl:0.1~Would you pick some up for me?

TRAD_RE_CP3_1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Treated myself to a second pair of socks yesterday.~sl:0.3~We are moving up in the world.

TRAD_RE_CP3_1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Goods have been flying off my table, so much so,~sl:0.0:2.0~I'm out of tanning supplies again.~sl:0.2~Could you grab some more for me?

TRAD_RE_CP3_1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Thanks partner. You know, I still can't believe~sl:~one of my ideas is actually working...

TRAD_RE_CP3_2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~You know, part of me, the part that normally gives up~sl:0.0:1.7~on things almost immediately,~sl:~wondered if I'd actually be able to do this.

TRAD_RE_CP3_2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~But, here we are... almost at full stock.~sl:0.3~I just need a few more supplies to finish the batch.

TRAD_RE_CP3_2_3 = ~z~Can you get those for me? We're nearly there.

TRAD_RE_CP3_3_1 = ~z~Things are looking good. We are building some serious inventory here.

TRAD_RE_CP3_3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.2:4.1:1~Who's the deadbeat now, Mrs. Cripps One, Two and Three?

TRAD_RE_CP3_3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Anyway, a few more supplies and~sl:0.0:1.9~I should be able to get this batch finished.~sl:0.1~Think you can grab those for me?

TRAD_RE_DEF1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~So, the other day I woke up face down in the mud with no~sl:~memory of the night before... and my first thought was...

TRAD_RE_DEF1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~what a great evening, but then it came to me...~sl:~a brainwave. Protection.

TRAD_RE_DEF1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0.:2.4~You help some of the locals deal with the outlaws~sl:~'round here, they pay you with supplies.

TRAD_RE_DEF1_4 = ~z~Everyone feels good about themselves. Genius, right?

TRAD_RE_DEF2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~I heard a few folks around here are getting shaken down~sl:~by some local heavies...

TRAD_RE_DEF2_2 = ~z~and since you like to kid yourself you're a do-gooder these days,

TRAD_RE_DEF2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~I figured maybe you could help them out~sl:0.0:2.2~in exchange for some supplies we need?~sl:~That way, everyone's happy.

TRAD_RE_DEF3_1 = ~z~So I bumped into a feller in town, told me he was having some problems with a gang 'round here.

TRAD_RE_DEF3_2 = ~z~He's also got some supplies we could use so I thought, why not kill two birds with one stone?

TRAD_RE_DEF3_3 = ~z~You help him out, he helps us out. And nobody even needs to get robbed.

TRAD_RE_DEFA1_1 = ~z~I've been thinking... it's time to give back to the community.

TRAD_RE_DEFA1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I want them to look at Cripps Trading Company and say~sl:~“that man is a hero of the people”.

TRAD_RE_DEFA1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~So, I heard some folks have been having trouble with~sl:~animals attacking their livestock.

TRAD_RE_DEFA1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Now maybe if you go help them out, they'll give us some~sl:~of the supplies we need in return.

TRAD_RE_DEFA2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Okay, my loyal foot soldier, I have sort of~sl:~promised your services to a feller near here...

TRAD_RE_DEFA2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~who told me he's having problems with some wild animals,~sl:~said he'd give us some supplies if we help him out.

TRAD_RE_DEFA2_3 = ~z~Well I assured him I had just the person for the job.

TRAD_RE_DEFA3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Okay, I know how you love to help people,~sl:~tiptoe the moral highground and all that...

TRAD_RE_DEFA3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~so I offered your services to some of our neighbors here~sl:0.0:3.2~who are being hassled by some kind of wild animals,~sl:~they didn't say what.

TRAD_RE_DEFA3_3 = ~z~Should be no problem for a hunter of your caliber.

TRAD_RE_DWOLF1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Okay, so I heard some of our competitors have gone~sl:~missing. Would you go see if you can track them down?

TRAD_RE_DWOLF1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Feels like the sporting thing to do. I sure hope nothing~sl:~bad's happened to them but, if it has, well,

TRAD_RE_DWOLF1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~no point letting their supplies go to waste.~sl:0.0:2.5~Always look for the silver lining, I say.~sl:~Just keep your eyes open.

TRAD_RE_DWOLF2_1 = ~z~Troubling news, I'm afraid. Some of our fellow traders set off for market but never arrived.

TRAD_RE_DWOLF2_2 = ~z~I was thinking you could go check on them and maybe lighten their load for the return journey?

TRAD_RE_DWOLF2_3 = ~z~Feels like the least we can do, don't you think? Good.

TRAD_RE_DWOLF3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Apparently some of our competitors never made it back~sl:~home from market, and folks are fearing the worst.

TRAD_RE_DWOLF3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~So, why don't you go try'n track 'em down~sl:~and see what's left of their supplies?

TRAD_RE_DWOLF3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~As the saying goes... all's fair in love, war...~sl:~and the trading of pristine animal parts.

TRAD_RE_MOVT1_1 = ~z~Alright, I think you know me, I'm all about playing fair.

TRAD_RE_MOVT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~But at this rate, by the time we get ahead~sl:~of the competition, I'll be dead in the dirt, so...

TRAD_RE_MOVT1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~I thought it might be quicker if we just borrowed~sl:~some of the items I need from some people...

TRAD_RE_MOVT1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~the sort of people who deserve to be borrowed from.~sl:0.6~I think you understand me?

TRAD_RE_MOVT2_1 = ~z~Alright, time for a little lesson on supply and demand.

TRAD_RE_MOVT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Now, when Group One, us, has a demand for supplies~sl:~and Group Two, them, has said supplies in their possession,

TRAD_RE_MOVT2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~how do we rebalance the economy?~sl:~By robbing them blind, of course. Simple.

TRAD_RE_MOVT3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.9~"Cripps Law, page fourteen : Robbing criminals isn't a crime."~sl:0.1:1.9:1~It just makes no sense.

TRAD_RE_MOVT3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~So, there's a gang or some such~sl:~on the move with some supplies we need...

TRAD_RE_MOVT3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~and I thought you'd be the perfect person to go give them~sl:~a taste of their own medicine. Just be careful.

TRAD_RE_SHRS1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~People always say there's no rules in business.~sl:0.4~Do they say that? I don't know. It sounds about right.

TRAD_RE_SHRS1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Well, guess who has just the supplies we need right now?~sl:~The local law.

TRAD_RE_SHRS1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~And who would be crazy enough to steal from the law?~sl:0.1:1.6:1~I'm looking right at them.

TRAD_RE_SHRS2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Okay, so the word on the street is that the local law is in~sl:~possession of some supplies that could be very useful to us.

TRAD_RE_SHRS2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~And, since you seem to have no qualms about getting your~sl:~hands dirty of late, I thought you might want to go take a look.

TRAD_RE_SHRS2_3 = ~z~Just, uh... don't get caught.

TRAD_RE_SHRS3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~So, some good news. The local law have been kind enough~sl:0.0:2.6~to lend us some supplies. Only thing is...~sl:0.0:1.5:1~they don't know about it yet.

TRAD_RE_SHRS3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~This is going to require a particular kind of angry lunatic,~sl:0.3~so I figured it was right up your alley.

TRAD_RE_SHRS3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~And I mean that as the highest of compliments.~sl:~Just please don't die.

TRAD_RE_STS1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~I'm sure you haven't forgotten it's my birthday, at least~sl:~I think it is. Certain dates have shifted over time.

TRAD_RE_STS1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Anyway, the old Cripps would have asked you for a case~sl:0.0:~of good brandy, but you know what the new Cripps wants?

TRAD_RE_STS1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Yes, tanning supplies! The only gift I need this year.~sl:~And next year, we'll be millionaires.

TRAD_RE_STS2_1 = ~z~Okay, I got another job for you, partner. I mean, I know strictly speaking you're still my boss,

TRAD_RE_STS2_2 = ~z~but I like to think we've always had a pretty flat hierarchy. Right?

TRAD_RE_STS2_3 = ~z~So, could you go collect some more preserving supplies for me? I just ran out again...

TRAD_RE_STS3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Don't worry, I'm not going to send you on another~sl:~supply errand... course I am.

TRAD_RE_STS3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Not that you'd ever admit it, but I think you rather enjoy it.~sl:0.2~Between your legwork and my craftwork, we're the perfect team.

TRAD_RE_STS3_3 = ~z~Anyway, you know the stuff I need... I'll leave it with you.

TRAD_RE_SUPT2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~A little dicky bird told me about some supplies coming in~sl:~on a train, supplies that we desperately need...

TRAD_RE_SUPT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Now we could sacrifice our precious capital and buy this~sl:~stuff, of course or... well, I think you know what to do.

TRAD_RE_SUPT2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I'm sure Leviticus Cornwall didn't get where he is with~sl:~hugs and kisses. Just try not to get killed.

TRAD_RE_SUPT3_1 = ~z~A Guinean once told me that no arrow flies truly straight.

TRAD_RE_SUPT3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~An entirely meaningless phrase, but one I like to come~sl:~back to when I'm grasping for moral justification.

TRAD_RE_SUPT3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~You know, like when there's a train full of supplies to rob.~sl:0.3~So fly crooked, my friend, and do what you do best.

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~I don't know, I seem to go through supplies~sl:0.0:2.0~like a hog goes through acorns.~sl:0.6~And hogs love acorn.

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Anyway, my trader pal has supplies for us~sl:~if you can do some hunting for him in exchange.

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM1_3 = ~z~Should be easy enough... all in a day's work for you.

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM2_1 = ~z~No rest for the wicked, not that you're all that wicked. A killer with a heart, I'd say, and who doesn't like that?

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM2_2 = ~z~Which is why I knew you wouldn't mind doing some hunting for my friend in exchange for some supplies...

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM2_3 = ~z~You know, some good honest bartering. Wonderful.

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.3:2.9~Don't come too close, my breath is lethal.~sl:0.7~Onions, it turns out... not a great snack.

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Anyway, enough of my dietary mishaps, we need supplies...~sl:0.1:2.4~and my contact says he's willing to trade~sl:~if you can do some hunting for him?

TRAD_RE_TRD_AM3_3 = ~z~Good honest work, just how you like it.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BDM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Okay, apparently my contact has some more goods to trade~sl:~if we can hunt and bring him some birds.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BDM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~I know... don't ask me what he wants them for.~sl:0.0:2.2~Best just to keep him happy, I reckon.~sl:0.2~I mean, we need the supplies.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BDM_3 = ~z~I'm sure you can handle that... right?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BHM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Now, you know, as a general rule I would rather~sl:~garrote myself with a rusty wire than help out the competition...

TRAD_RE_TRD_BHM_2 = ~z~but needs must, and our needs are supplies right now.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BHM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Could you go hunt some bighorn and pay my contact~sl:~a visit, see if he's willing to trade?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BHM_4 = ~z~Oh, they're the uh, sheep with the, er, big horns.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRM_1 = ~z~You know, you're really an excellent hunter.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~One of the best I've ever known, the sort of person who~sl:~faces down grizzlies without skipping a beat.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Which is why I sort of promised my friend~sl:0.0:1.9~you'd deliver him some bear pelts~sl:~in exchange for some supplies, okay?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRM_4 = ~z~Like I said, you're the best.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Okay, it goes without saying that only a lunatic would hunt~sl:~a bear, so I need you to hunt a bear.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.6:3.6~Only joking, you've been very well-behaved of late.~sl:0.0:2.4~But my contact's been in touch again,~sl:~said he'd trade some more supplies for a bear pelt.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BRS_3 = ~z~Can I leave that with you?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSM_1 = ~z~My contact sent a message... apparently, he has goods to trade if we can get him some bison pelts.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSM_2 = ~z~And God knows there's enough bison to go around. So I said you'd be in touch shortly.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSM_3 = ~z~My Lord, was there ever a man more cut out for this than me?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Did I ever tell you, back in the day I once killed~sl:~thirty bison in an hour?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~That's like a bison a minute, that's...~sl:0.0:2.7~no, no, a bison every three minutes...~sl:~no... anyway, it was impressive, but...

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSS_3 = ~z~I leave all that to the young'uns these days, like yourself.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BSS_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~My contact's willing to trade again for a bison pelt.~sl:~Think you can handle that?

TRAD_RE_TRD_BVM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Well, I heard from my contact again... he's after some~sl:0.0:3.4~beaver pelts and carcasses. Now, normally I'd say no,~sl:~but he's got some supplies we need.

TRAD_RE_TRD_BVM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Now I'd do this myself, of course, but a good businessman~sl:~knows how to delegate. So, uh, just try to be nice to him, okay?

TRAD_RE_TRD_CGM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Alright, since I know how much you love hunting,~sl:0.0:2.4~I kind of promised your services to my friend~sl:~in return for some supplies.

TRAD_RE_TRD_CGM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Nothing too much, he's just after a few, er,~sl:~cougars for a taxidermist client of his.

TRAD_RE_TRD_CGM_3 = ~z~Should keep you out of mischief for... quite a while.

TRAD_RE_TRD_CGS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Alright, since you are a person of principle and honor~sl:~these days, and I mean that with only a pinch of sarcasm,

TRAD_RE_TRD_CGS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~I need you to do a favor for a friend.~sl:0.0:3.9~He's after a cougar for some hat or charm he's making...~sl:~I ain't sure, I was fairly drunk at the time.

TRAD_RE_TRD_CGS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~But he's willing to trade some supplies in return.~sl:~Should be easy enough for you?

TRAD_RE_TRD_DRM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~You know, I'm all for a barter economy.~sl:0.0:3.1~Like the good old days before we all became beholden to~sl:~pieces of shiny paper.

TRAD_RE_TRD_DRM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Anyway, my friend has some more goods to trade~sl:0.0:2.0~if we can hunt him some deer.~sl:~And by we, I obviously mean you.

TRAD_RE_TRD_DRM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~I have enough on my plate.~sl:~Thanks, partner. You're the best.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Doesn't it feel good to be earning a good, solid,~sl:0.0:2.1:1~almost honest living for once?

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I heard from my contact, he's ready to trade again...~sl:~I told him I send my best person. You, of course.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Strictly speaking, also my worst person.~sl:~But anyway... get to it.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Tit for tat. Quid pro quo. I don't really know what any of~sl:~these things mean, but traders must trade...

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~so I've set up a meet with my contact to barter some~sl:~supplies. And uh, I was hoping you could handle that?

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN2_3 = ~z~My poor knees are burning again.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~You know, I'm always thinking...~sl:0.0:2.2~it's a blessing and a curse.~sl:~And I don't always remember much of it.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~So before I forget, a friend of mine wants to trade some supplies.~sl:~Good honest work, just how you like it.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GN3_3 = ~z~I can see how excited you are about this.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GTM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~So I heard from my trader friend...~sl:~I don't like abetting the competition, but uh, I trust him

TRAD_RE_TRD_GTM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~and he's got some supplies we could really use right now.~sl:~He's after some gator skins, so...

TRAD_RE_TRD_GTM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~I figured you'd be able to arrange that for him.~sl:~I'm always singing your praises, you know me.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GTS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~My contact has some more supplies for us, said he'd~sl:~trade them for a gator skin, if you can arrange that?

TRAD_RE_TRD_GTS_2 = ~z~Just make it snappy. Sorry, I'm a couple of brandies deep.

TRAD_RE_TRD_GTS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~One day I'll have to tell you about the thousand-pound~sl:~alligator I wrestled... no, it didn't actually happen, but it's a good story.

TRAD_RE_TRD_HBM_1 = ~z~"How does it feel being a tycoon of industry", you might ask me. Well, I wouldn't really know yet.

TRAD_RE_TRD_HBM_2 = ~z~I don't even have a roof over my head. But we are getting closer every day.

TRAD_RE_TRD_HBM_3 = ~z~So, can you go pick some herbs and see if my contact is willing to trade some supplies for them?

TRAD_RE_TRD_PGN_1 = ~z~Ah, the life of a visionary craftsman. Always one step ahead of the pack.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PGN_2 = ~z~Now, I've negotiated a trade with my friend for more supplies, if you can do some hunting for him.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PGN_3 = ~z~He needs pigs... or boars, peccaries... anything vaguely porcine, I guess. Bacon is bacon.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8:1~Supplies, supplies, the endless quest for supplies.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Anyway, I've cut a deal with a friend of mine who's willing~sl:~to trade for some pelts and carcasses.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.5~Just a few cute little kitty cats... well, panthers to be exact.~sl:~But, shouldn't be a problem for you, right?

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~My friend was telling me he has a client willing to pay~sl:~top dollar for a panther, some taxidermist I think.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~And I said, "Only a maniac would hunt a panther..."~sl:0.0:1.8~"I've got just the person!"~sl:1.0~One of these days I'll get you to crack a smile.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Anyways, I told him "I don't want your money..."~sl:~"I want your supplies". And he said “deal”.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PNS_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~So most of the legwork's done on this...~sl:~except for the panther part.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PSM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Another glamorous job for you...~sl:~my contact is after some possums,

TRAD_RE_TRD_PSM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~I'm not sure what for, but... it's making me wish~sl:~I hadn't eaten that pie when I last saw him.

TRAD_RE_TRD_PSM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~If you can hunt a few and deliver them to him on a plate...~sl:~wait, wait, no, no, definitely not on a plate...

TRAD_RE_TRD_PSM_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Well, he said he'll give us some supplies in return.~sl:~Happy hunting.

TRAD_RE_TRD_RCM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Okay, my friend's agreed to trade us some supplies~sl:~if we can hunt some raccoons for him.

TRAD_RE_TRD_RCM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I think he's planning to make some hats with them...~sl:~or something, not sure, a man's business is his own.

TRAD_RE_TRD_RCM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Clever little things, raccoons. I know a feller who trained~sl:0.0:~one to ride a bicycle once.

TRAD_RE_TRD_RCM_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~They can't see colors, though, terrible at poker.~sl:0.1~Anyway, I digress and you have work to do.

TRAD_RE_TRD_WFM_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Okay, we need more supplies... I'm sorry,~sl:0.0:2.6:1~ain't my fault I work at such a blistering pace.

TRAD_RE_TRD_WFM_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~My friend's willing to trade us some,~sl:0.0:2.2~so I need a very small favor,~sl:~almost nothing at all, the slightest of errands...

TRAD_RE_TRD_WFM_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Just need you to hunt a few wolves~sl:~and deliver them to him. That's it.

TRAD_RE_TRD_WFS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~I like this new working relationship we got going now.~sl:~Feels, you know, a little less feudal.

TRAD_RE_TRD_WFS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Well, anyway, a job for you.~sl:0.0:2.8~My trader friend wants a wolf, no questions asked...~sl:0.1~a dead one, I should add.

TRAD_RE_TRD_WFS_3 = ~z~Said he'd give us some supplies in return. Easy enough, right?

TRAD_RE_UNSP1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Well, there's a lot to be said for an existence of lazy debauchery.~sl:~Running a business is harder than it looks.

TRAD_RE_UNSP1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~And at this rate, I'll be wearing a marble hat~sl:~before I get a taste of the good life.

TRAD_RE_UNSP1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~So, I think it's time to cut a few corners~sl:0.0:1.7~and borrow some items from one of the~sl:~local businesses to help speed things along.

TRAD_RE_UNSP1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.2~Dog eat dog and all that.

TRAD_RE_UNSP2_1 = ~z~Now you know how I am, I prefer to do things by the book.

TRAD_RE_UNSP2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~But there's a local business with some~sl:0.0:2.4~very attractive merchandise in stock~sl:0.2~and should that fall into our possession,

TRAD_RE_UNSP2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~well, I think I'd be willing to bend my ethics just this once.~sl:~The rest I leave to you.

TRAD_RE_UNSP3_1 = ~z~Now you know me, I ain't a feller to judge.

TRAD_RE_UNSP3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~And to ignore your nefarious tendencies would be to~sl:~overlook a potential asset, which is just bad business.

TRAD_RE_UNSP3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~So I was thinking if you could pay a visit to a certain store~sl:~not far from here and relieve them of a few items,

TRAD_RE_UNSP3_4 = ~z~well like I say, who am I to judge? Just be careful, of course.

TRAD_SL_FAR1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Did I ever tell you about the time I stowed away on a ship~sl:~and ended up imprisoned by the Sultanate of Sulu?

TRAD_SL_FAR1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~No? Well, remind me later... it's a corker.~sl:~Anyway, business first, time to make a sale.

TRAD_SL_FAR1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~The buyer's not local, but we're getting a good price,~sl:~so should be worth the ride.

TRAD_SL_FAR1_4 = ~z~Just be careful, this is precious cargo.

TRAD_SL_FAR2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Right, I've got a batch ready to go,~sl:~and a buyer already lined up...

TRAD_SL_FAR2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Now, I've basically done all the hard work,~sl:0.1:2.2~all you need to do is go make the sale.~sl:0.2~Bit of a trek, but... I know you like a ride.

TRAD_SL_FAR2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.4:3.1~Why didn't I come up with this idea forty years ago?~sl:~I'd be living in a palace by now...

TRAD_SL_FAR3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~Now, first off,~sl:0.0:3.4~if you stumbled across that latrine situation out back...~sl:~my sincere apologies.

TRAD_SL_FAR3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~You know, you leave soup out in the sun,~sl:0.0:2.1~you pay the price...~sl:~talking of which, I've found us a buyer!

TRAD_SL_FAR3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Now, it'll be a long ride, but they're offering good money.~sl:~So just keep your eyes out for bandits.

TRAD_SL_FAR4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~You know, I really feel like a new man. All these long~sl:~dormant passions surging through me once more.

TRAD_SL_FAR4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~So, while I head into town in search of some, er, company,~sl:~could you go make a sale?

TRAD_SL_FAR4_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~It'll be a bit of a journey, I'm afraid, but~sl:~the buyer's offering good money.

TRAD_SL_FAR5_1 = ~z~Alright, old Cripps has done it again... goods ready to go? Yes. Buyer lined up? Yes.

TRAD_SL_FAR5_2 = ~z~All you need to do is make the sale. Bit of a ride for you, but the money's good.

TRAD_SL_FAR5_3 = ~z~Ah, if my kids could only see me now... I swear, I'd introduce myself and apologize.

TRAD_SL_FAR6_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Well , this really has been quite the emotional journey~sl:0.0:~for me.  From self-indulgence to self-discipline...

TRAD_SL_FAR6_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~you must be so proud of me. Anyway,~sl:0.0:2.5~talking of journeys, we have some buyers lined up...~sl:~they ain't local, but they pay well.

TRAD_SL_FAR6_3 = ~z~So go make me proud too, partner.

TRAD_SL_NEAR1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~This is the life, huh? Self-sufficient, answering to no one.~sl:~We are making something of ourselves.

TRAD_SL_NEAR1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Now this might even put a smile on your face...~sl:0.2~it's time to make a sale.

TRAD_SL_NEAR1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~I've found some buyers locally, not the highest price, but~sl:~easy money... and I'll take easy over hard any day.

TRAD_SL_NEAR2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Well, we make quite the couple, don't we?~sl:0.4:2.8:1~Not like that... you're far too old for me.

TRAD_SL_NEAR2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Anyway, artisan and hunter, craftsman and salesman...~sl:~talking of which, we have a batch ready to go.

TRAD_SL_NEAR2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Got some buyers lined up not far from here.~sl:~So over to you, go make the deal.

TRAD_SL_NEAR3_1 = ~z~Good news, we have another batch ready for market.

TRAD_SL_NEAR3_2 = ~z~Buyers are lined up, not too far from here, so all you have to do is head over and make the sale.

TRAD_SL_NEAR3_3 = ~z~I just keep surprising myself... and to think my pa said I'd be a drunken hobo my whole life.

TRAD_SL_NEAR4_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Alright, my friend, time to make some money.~sl:0.2~There's another batch ready to go. Sure feels good.

TRAD_SL_NEAR4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~It wasn't easy... I've cut myself so many times it's a~sl:~miracle I've got any blood left in me... Anyway,

TRAD_SL_NEAR4_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~got a local buyer lined up, so,~sl:~should be an easy run for you.

TRAD_SL_NEAR5_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~You know I love you like a wayward child,~sl:0.8:2.5~but I wouldn't say charm's your best trait~sl:0.2~so I'm going to need you to dig deep here...

TRAD_SL_NEAR5_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~because we have a sale to make.~sl:0.2:2.5~The buyer's already lined up, ain't top dollar~sl:~but it's local so it's nice and easy, so...

TRAD_SL_NEAR5_3 = ~z~over to you, charmer.

TRAD_SL_NEAR6_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I was just thinking... have you ever wondered~sl:~why they call it a building when it's already built?

TRAD_SL_NEAR6_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Okay, sorry, too deep... anyway I have some good news.~sl:~Another batch ready for market!

TRAD_SL_NEAR6_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~“Well done, Cripps, you're amazing”. “Why thank you”.~sl:~And now it's over to you...

TRAD_SL_NEAR6_4 = ~z~The buyer's local, so should be an easy enough sale.

TRAD_TM_REAVAIL_01 = ~z~Okay, I'm out of supplies here.

TRAD_TM_REAVAIL_02 = ~z~I've had to halt production for now, need more supplies.

TRAD_TM_REAVAIL_03 = ~z~I can do anything else until I get some more supplies.

TRAD_TM_REHALF_01 = ~z~So, I'm about halfway through production but need to stock up on more supplies.

TRAD_TM_REHALF_02 = ~z~I'd say I've got about half the batch done at this stage, but I'm out of supplies again.

TRAD_TM_REHALF_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~I've had to stop for now, but I can push on with the rest as~sl:~soon as I get more supplies. I'm about halfway through.

TRAD_TM_RELARGE_01 = ~z~Almost there, I just need a few more supplies.

TRAD_TM_RELARGE_02 = ~z~So close, a few more supplies and I can get this batch finished.

TRAD_TM_RELARGE_03 = ~z~Can't believe it. I was so nearly done, but I ran out of supplies.

TRAD_TM_RESMALL_01 = ~z~I've made some progress here, but I need a few more supplies.

TRAD_TM_RESMALL_02 = ~z~I've made a little headway, but I'm out of supplies now, unfortunately.

TRAD_TM_RESMALL_03 = ~z~Well I have some goods ready to go, at least, but I need to restock before I can do much else.

TRAD_TM_SLAVAIL_01 = ~z~Okay, I've got a small batch of goods ready for sale.

TRAD_TM_SLAVAIL_02 = ~z~Got a small batch here ready for market.

TRAD_TM_SLAVAIL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Got a batch here ready for sale.~sl:~Ain't the largest, but it's enough.

TRAD_TM_SLFULL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Listen, there's no point in me making all this~sl:~if you ain't gonna sell it.

TRAD_TM_SLFULL_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Look, I'm sorry, I ain't going to bother making anything else~sl:~until you make a sale. It's just sitting here.

TRAD_TM_SLFULL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Sorry, I'm on strike until you actually sell something.~sl:~At the moment, this is a hobby, not a business.

TRAD_TM_SLMED_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~There's a decent batch here ready to go~sl:~whenever you can make the sale.

TRAD_TM_SLMED_02 = ~z~Got a batch ready to go out, decent amount too.

TRAD_TM_SLMED_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Next batch of goods is ready to go out.~sl:~And it's a fairly healthy one.

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_01 = ~z~Hey there, ready to do some business?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_02 = ~z~Looking to trade?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_03 = ~z~Here to make a deal?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_05 = ~z~Howdy, you here to trade?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_06 = ~z~Is this business or pleasure?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_07 = ~z~Hi there, you got business for me?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_08 = ~z~Ready to make a trade?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_09 = ~z~I assume you're here to do some business?

TRAD_TRD_APPRCH_10 = ~z~Mr. Cripps sent you over, huh?

TRAD_TRD_FAIL_01 = ~z~Guess this is why they say the early bird gets the worm.

TRAD_TRD_FAIL_02 = ~z~What happened out there? No luck?

TRAD_TRD_FAIL_03 = ~z~Guess that didn't go so well, huh?

TRAD_TRD_FLM_01 = ~z~Are you here to make up for last time?

TRAD_TRD_FLM_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Didn't go too well last time, did it?~sl:0.5~Guess I can give you another chance...

TRAD_TRD_FLM_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~Well...~sl:0.0:1.2~I ain't even sure I should be~sl:0.0:0.9~bothering with you after last time...~sl:0.5~but we all make mistakes... I guess.

TRAD_TRD_GIVEM_01 = ~z~That's everything. Good work. Those supplies are all yours.

TRAD_TRD_GIVEM_02 = ~z~Good. That's the lot. Feel free to take those supplies now.

TRAD_TRD_GIVES_01 = ~z~This is just what I needed. Feel free to help yourself to those supplies.

TRAD_TRD_GIVES_02 = ~z~This'll do me nicely. You can grab yourself those supplies.

TRAD_TRD_GIVES_03 = ~z~That'll do the trick. You've earned yourself those supplies.

TRAD_TRD_HAND_01 = ~z~That's a start, but I ain't trading until you bring me the lot.

TRAD_TRD_HAND_02 = ~z~Nice work, now bring me the rest.

TRAD_TRD_HAND_03 = ~z~Not bad but I can't trade till you bring me everything.

TRAD_TRD_HAND_04 = ~z~That's a good start for sure, but it ain't everything I asked for, unfortunately.

TRAD_TRD_HAND_05 = ~z~Alright, good. Now bring me the rest and we can trade.

TRAD_TRD_HAND_06 = ~z~Thank you, but I need the full batch before I can make a trade.

TRAD_TRD_IDLENS_01 = ~z~Well don't let me keep you.

TRAD_TRD_IDLENS_02 = ~z~You should probably get those supplies back to old Cripps.

TRAD_TRD_IDLENS_03 = ~z~You better get that stuff back to Mr. Cripps. I'm sure he's champing at the bit.

TRAD_TRD_IDLEYS_01 = ~z~Go on, take them.

TRAD_TRD_PLM_03 = ~z~Nice job last time. Let's see if you can make another deal.

TRAD_TRD_RETWO_01 = ~z~Hey, I thought you had some hunting to do?

TRAD_TRD_RETWO_02 = ~z~What's this? I've always learned to beware the person not bearing gifts.

TRAD_TRD_RETWO_03 = ~z~Is this just a social call? Because I can't trade you something for nothing.

TRAD_TRD_RETW_01 = ~z~You had some luck, I see.

TRAD_TRD_RETW_02 = ~z~This looks promising.

TRAD_TRD_RETW_03 = ~z~That's what I like to see.
