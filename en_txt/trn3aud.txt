TRN3_EXT_1 = ~z~Well, I guess old Dutch got all the smoke he wants.

TRN3_EXT_2 = ~z~Well let's hope so.

TRN3_EXT_3 = ~z~You really think that that'll draw attention away from us?

TRN3_EXT_4 = ~z~I guess we'll see.

TRN3_EXT_5 = ~z~Tell the truth...

TRN3_EXT_6 = ~z~I ain't even sure I fully understand Dutch's plan with all this.

TRN3_EXT_7 = ~z~Like I said, John...

TRN3_EXT_8 = ~z~when the time comes, you go.

TRN3_EXT_9 = ~z~But what about loyalty to...

TRN3_EXT_10 = ~z~to everything?

TRN3_EXT_11 = ~z~You been loyal.

TRN3_EXT_12 = ~z~I been loyal.

TRN3_EXT_18 = ~z~Soon...

TRN3_EXT_19 = ~z~you gotta go.

TRN3_EXT_20 = ~z~Go...

TRN3_EXT_21 = ~z~don't look back.

TRN3_EXT_22 = ~z~I'll think about it.

TRN3_EXT_24 = ~z~Look at us...

TRN3_EXT_25 = ~z~out here risking our necks...

TRN3_EXT_26 = ~z~and for what exactly?

TRN3_EXT_27 = ~z~For a...

TRN3_EXT_28 = ~z~For a silly idea?

TRN3_EXT_29 = ~z~It don't even exist.

TRN3_EXT_30 = ~z~How you mean?

TRN3_EXT_31 = ~z~You know just what I mean.

TRN3_EXT_32 = ~z~You need cash.

TRN3_EXT_33 = ~z~You got a family.

TRN3_EXT_34 = ~z~I'll think about it.

TRN3_EXT_35 = ~z~I've done a lot of thinking.

TRN3_EXT_36 = ~z~Look at us...

TRN3_EXT_37 = ~z~out here risking our necks...

TRN3_EXT_39 = ~z~For a...

TRN3_EXT_40 = ~z~An idea that don't work no more.

TRN3_EXT_41 = ~z~How you mean?

TRN3_EXT_42 = ~z~You know just what I mean.

TRN3_EXT_43 = ~z~You got a family.

TRN3_EXT_44 = ~z~You need cash...

TRN3_EXT_45 = ~z~you need to start building a life for yourself.

TRN3_EXT_46 = ~z~Me?

TRN3_EXT_47 = ~z~Well, I need a vacation...

TRN3_EXT_48 = ~z~and Dutch...

TRN3_EXT_49 = ~z~has all the money.

TRN3_EXT_50 = ~z~For safekeeping.

TRN3_EXT_51 = ~z~You know something...

TRN3_EXT_52 = ~z~Abigail...

TRN3_EXT_53 = ~z~thinks she might know where some of that money is.

TRN3_EXT_54 = ~z~Well you tell her she better make sure...

TRN3_EXT_55 = ~z~and then come talk to me...

TRN3_EXT_56 = ~z~and we'll find out just who and what we should be loyal to.

TRN3_EXT_57 = ~z~I-I don't know, Arthur.

TRN3_EXT_58 = ~z~Nor do I...

TRN3_EXT_59 = ~z~but I am starting to see things clearly now.

TRN3_EXT_60 = ~z~I ain't being taken for a fool no more.

TRN3_EXT_61 = ~z~Get out of here.

TRN3_EXT_62 = ~z~Come on!

TRN3_EXT_63 = ~z~Nor do I...

TRN3_EXT_64 = ~z~but I'm seeing things a lot more clearly now.

TRN3_EXT_65 = ~z~I wish things were different...

TRN3_GB_BANT1_3 = ~z~we're about to blow up a bridge, for Christ's sake.

TRN3_GB_C1CLOSE_1 = ~z~That's it... nearly there.

TRN3_GB_C1DONE_1 = ~z~Okay, good. Grab the other one.

TRN3_GB_C1START_1 = ~z~Alright, take it slow... that's not something we wanna drop.

TRN3_GB_CRATE1W_01 = ~z~Are you getting the crate?

TRN3_GB_CRATE1W_02 = ~z~Grab the first one, come on.

TRN3_GB_CRATE1W_03 = ~z~Hurry, Arthur.

TRN3_GB_CRATE2W_01 = ~z~Hurry, Arthur, before someone sees us.

TRN3_GB_INPOS2W_01 = ~z~Okay, let's go.

TRN3_GB_INPOS2W_02 = ~z~Start lowering it, Arthur.

TRN3_GB_INPOS2W_03 = ~z~Just like last time, come on.

TRN3_GB_INPOS_1 = ~z~I'm at the bottom of the ladder here to your left.

TRN3_GB_LOWCRAT_1 = ~z~Nice and easy.

TRN3_GB_START_1 = ~z~Let's ride this thing out onto the bridge.

TRN3_GB_START_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~There's a spot about a third of the way across~sl:~where we can get down underneath to plant the charges.

TRN3_GB_START_3 = ~z~I've already set up the detonator.

TRN3_GB_START_4 = ~z~Sure, let's get this over with.

TRN3_HERE_1 = ~z~Okay, grab yourself a bundle from the box.

TRN3_IG9_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Um... I think the line held.~sl:0.6~You want the honors?

TRN3_INT_2 = ~z~How you doing?

TRN3_INT_3 = ~z~Nervous, but...

TRN3_INT_4 = ~z~I've been nervous for a while.

TRN3_INT_5 = ~z~I had a lot of time to think in that jail and...

TRN3_INT_6 = ~z~I feel like I just don't know Dutch no more.

TRN3_INT_7 = ~z~You ain't the only one.

TRN3_INT_8 = ~z~And this plan to get us out, it just feels...

TRN3_INT_9 = ~z~I don't know...

TRN3_INT_10 = ~z~Like he's stringing us along, I know...

TRN3_INT_11 = ~z~Killing in cold blood, revenge, we all do bad things, but...

TRN3_INT_12 = ~z~he seems to enjoy it now.

TRN3_INT_13 = ~z~It's like he just wants to create more enemies. More chaos.

TRN3_INT_14 = ~z~Yeah, I know.

TRN3_INT_15 = ~z~I mean... I love Dutch.

TRN3_INT_16 = ~z~He saved me a long time ago.

TRN3_INT_17 = ~z~I feel like in Saint Denis, when I got arrested...

TRN3_INT_18 = ~z~maybe he could have done something.

TRN3_INT_19 = ~z~I feel like you should take your woman and child...

TRN3_INT_20 = ~z~and get lost.

TRN3_INT_21 = ~z~Do you?

TRN3_INT_22 = ~z~You can... you could give something to Jack.

TRN3_INT_23 = ~z~It's that or... well, I don't see no way outta this.

TRN3_INT_24 = ~z~Well, what about loyalty?

TRN3_INT_25 = ~z~Be loyal to what matters.

TRN3_INT_26 = ~z~What are you gonna do?

TRN3_INT_27 = ~z~I-I'll be okay... but do it, for me.

TRN3_INT_28 = ~z~And it would make me...

TRN3_INT_29 = ~z~ feel...

TRN3_INT_30 = ~z~good, if that makes any sense.

TRN3_INT_31 = ~z~A little, but...

TRN3_INT_32 = ~z~Listen to me...

TRN3_INT_33 = ~z~I feel like you should take your woman and child...

TRN3_INT_34 = ~z~and get lost.

TRN3_INT_35 = ~z~Do you?

TRN3_INT_36 = ~z~What reason you got to stick around at this point?

TRN3_INT_37 = ~z~It's done, I don't see no way outta any of this.

TRN3_INT_38 = ~z~What about loyalty?

TRN3_INT_39 = ~z~That's long been broken.

TRN3_INT_40 = ~z~Well, what are you gonna do?

TRN3_INT_41 = ~z~I gotta see this through, try and make some of it right.

TRN3_INT_42 = ~z~There was a code we had, gotta still mean something.

TRN3_INT_43 = ~z~Sure, I know, but...

TRN3_INT_44 = ~z~Listen to me...

TRN3_INT_45 = ~z~when the time comes...

TRN3_INT_46 = ~z~you gotta run, and don't look back.

TRN3_INT_47 = ~z~This is over.

TRN3_INT_48 = ~z~And now?

TRN3_INT_49 = ~z~Now, we gotta help Dutch give the army one final tweak on its nose.

TRN3_INT_50 = ~z~Yeah, come on...

TRN3_INT_51 = ~z~help me with the rest of this.

TRN3_INT_52 = ~z~Well, it looks like we finally found our calling in life.

TRN3_INT_LEADIN_2 = ~z~How you doing?

TRN3_INT_LEADIN_3 = ~z~Nervous...

TRN3_INT_LEADIN_4 = ~z~but...

TRN3_LB_UP_1 = ~z~We still need the other box, Arthur. Get back up there.

TRN3_LD_EDGE_01 = ~z~You're too far back.

TRN3_LD_EDGE_02 = ~z~Come closer to the edge.

TRN3_LD_EDGE_03 = ~z~Closer to the railing, Arthur.

TRN3_LD_LEFT_01 = ~z~Left a bit, Arthur.

TRN3_LD_LEFT_02 = ~z~Come left.

TRN3_LD_LEFT_03 = ~z~That's too far right.

TRN3_LD_RIGHT1_01 = ~z~There's good. Lower it down.

TRN3_LD_RIGHT1_02 = ~z~Okay, you should be good there.

TRN3_LD_RIGHT1_03 = ~z~That's the spot, lower it from there.

TRN3_LD_RIGHT_01 = ~z~No, more to your right.

TRN3_LD_RIGHT_02 = ~z~You're too far left.

TRN3_PD_BANT2SHOUTED_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Dutch wants a distraction...~sl:0.5~something to buy us some time... pull some attention off of us.

TRN3_PD_BANT2SHOUTED_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~And we found out Cornwall's company's got a contract~sl:~with the army, so I think Dutch figures, after this,

TRN3_PD_BANT2SHOUTED_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~they'll need to send up a train with cash and supplies.~sl:0.6~And then we'll rob that train.

TRN3_PD_BANT2SHOUTED_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~It would have sounded crazy six months ago.~sl:0.4~Now, it sounds pretty normal.

TRN3_PD_BANT2SPOKEN_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Dutch wants a distraction...~sl:0.4~something to buy us some time... pull some attention off of us.

TRN3_PD_BANT2SPOKEN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~And we found out Cornwall's company's got a contract~sl:~with the army, so I think Dutch figures, after this,

TRN3_PD_BANT2SPOKEN_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~It would have sounded crazy six months ago.~sl:0.5~Now? It sounds pretty normal.

TRN3_PD_BANT2_1 = ~z~So why exactly are we doing this?

TRN3_PD_BANT2_5 = ~z~I don't know... this all sounds pretty crazy to me.

TRN3_PD_BANT2_7 = ~z~I guess Cornwall's legacy lives on.

TRN3_PD_BANT2_8 = ~z~In a way, I guess so.

TRN3_PD_DYNRE_01 = ~z~Quick as you can, Arthur.
