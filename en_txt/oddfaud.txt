RODDF_S1_EXT_15 = ~z~He wouldn't have abandoned us.

RODDF_S1_EXT_16 = ~z~And you wouldn't have got that whoopsy, would you?

RODDF_S1_EXT_17 = ~z~Whoopsy hurt.

RODDF_S1_EXT_18 = ~z~I know, momma's gonna make it all better...

RODDF_S1_EXT_19 = ~z~but first, you gotta tell me where that little worm ran off to.

RODDF_S1_EXT_20 = ~z~But Bertram promised.

RODDF_S1_EXT_21 = ~z~Yes, well, Magnifico made a promise too, huh?

RODDF_S1_EXT_22 = ~z~He made more than a promise...

RODDF_S1_EXT_23 = ~z~he made a contract, and he broke it.

RODDF_S1_EXT_24 = ~z~So, you just tell me exactly where he is...

RODDF_S1_EXT_25 = ~z~and then we will all be even.

RODDF_S1_EXT_26 = ~z~That's my boy.

RODDF_S1_EXT_27 = ~z~He's camping in the woods.

RODDF_S1_EXT_28 = ~z~Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

RODDF_S1_EXT_29 = ~z~You just apologize to these men.

RODDF_S1_EXT_30 = ~z~I'm sorry.

RODDF_S1_EXT_31 = ~z~I'm sorry.

RODDF_S1_EXT_32 = ~z~You gave me a whoopsy.

RODDF_S1_EXT_33 = ~z~Hey, you just stay away from that sherry now, you hear?

RODDF_S1_EXT_34 = ~z~Bertram like sherry.

RODDF_S1_EXT_35 = ~z~Oh, don't you get him started.

RODDF_S1_EXT_36 = ~z~Thank you for all of your help, Mr. Stranger.

RODDF_S1_EXT_37 = ~z~If you see that slippery little feller sleeping rough out there...

RODDF_S1_EXT_38 = ~z~would you just make a little racket...

RODDF_S1_EXT_39 = ~z~and then we'll come along, and we'll find you.

RODDF_S1_EXT_41 = ~z~Oh, his name is Magnifico.

RODDF_S1_EXT_42 = ~z~You'll know him when you see him.

RODDF_S1_EXT_43 = ~z~Come along, Bertram.

RODDF_S1_EXT_44 = ~z~Maybe you should think about who you're serving.

RODDF_S1_EXT_45 = ~z~Gimme a beer will you?

RODDF_S1_EXT_46 = ~z~You just stay away from that sherry, you hear?

RODDF_S1_EXT_47 = ~z~I could try.

RODDF_S1_IG1_3 = ~z~Oh, that's nice, that's very nice.

RODDF_S1_IG1_4 = ~z~"Friends for life," we said and now the two of you have betrayed me at once.

RODDF_S1_IG1_5 = ~z~Do you know what betrayal means, Bertram?

RODDF_S1_IG1_6 = ~z~No...

RODDF_S1_IG1_7 = ~z~It means hurting Miss Marjorie...

RODDF_S1_IG1_8 = ~z~Well, I thought you liked me? I've clothed you, I fed you.

RODDF_S1_IG1_9 = ~z~Bertram does like Miss Marjorie.

RODDF_S1_IG1_10 = ~z~Yes. And Miss Marjorie likes Bertram...

RODDF_S1_IG1_11 = ~z~So why don't you go and tell me where that nasty little Magnifico has run off to so I can get on with whipping that snot nose runt into shape!

RODDF_S1_IG1_12 = ~z~He owes me. He owes us, big time... Bertram and Marjorie.

RODDF_S1_IG1_13 = ~z~Would Bertram like a sherry?

RODDF_S1_IG1_14 = ~z~Bertram like sherry.

RODDF_S1_INT_4 = ~z~like a mother.

RODDF_S1_INT_5 = ~z~Caring and raising them...

RODDF_S1_INT_6 = ~z~and then they go and stab you in the back.

RODDF_S1_INT_7 = ~z~Have you ever betrayed a close friend?

RODDF_S1_INT_8 = ~z~I hope not.

RODDF_S1_INT_9 = ~z~Well, uh...

RODDF_S1_INT_10 = ~z~Treachery...

RODDF_S1_INT_11 = ~z~and these are sad, low, unlovable people...
