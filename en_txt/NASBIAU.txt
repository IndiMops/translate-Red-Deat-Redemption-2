NASBI_BANT3B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.88~The thing must have a coat of goddam silver and gold~sl:~for all the time we've wasted chasing it down.

NASBI_BANT3B_3 = ~z~If we're patient enough. We find out.

NASBI_CAGE2_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.23~Getting hot in there, big feller?~sl:1.41~Smells like you're half-roasted already!

NASBI_CAGE2_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.18~It's gonna take a long time to skin you, my friend!~sl:0.42:2.5~Spare a thought for us doing the hard work, huh?

NASBI_FOLLOW_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I can't believe I am stuck here while the others go in for the kill.~sl:0.5~They are lost without me, anyway.

NASBI_FOLLOW_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.19~That bison leaves a trail of red moult so big even your compadres could find it.~sl:0.44~It won't be long.

NASBI_FOLLOW_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~If they don't come back with a beautiful red hide today,~sl:0.0:1.44~I'm going out there on my own.~sl:0.4~Idiots.

NASBI_GUARD_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.85~I hope they miss it.~sl:0.34~And next time, someone else can play at guard duty.

NASBI_GUARD_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~I am so bored.~sl:0.44~I'm a hunter too, dammit. I should be there at the kill.

NASBI_THREAT1_01 = ~z~Listen good to me. This here beastie is ours, so move along.

NASBI_THREAT1_03 = ~z~Wandered into something that don't concern you here. Off you go.

NASBI_THREAT2_01 = ~z~Get lost, or I will truss you up and throw you in that cage as a snack.

NASBI_THREAT2_02 = ~z~Do not push me, or we'll have ourselves two hides to sell today.

NASBI_THREAT3_01 = ~z~I won't say it again. Leave, or get stuck like a hog.

NASBI_THREAT3_02 = ~z~This is it. I will kill you where you stand.

NASBI_THREAT3_03 = ~z~Oh, I killed a lot more than bison, friend. Last chance.

NASBI_WARN1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.29~Hey there, you bound for the valley?~sl:0.6~'Cause there's some kinda band of hunters down there, real jackasses.

NASBI_WARN1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.32~Chased me off for no reason.~sl:0.44~If you don't want the same treatment, move fast and lie low.

NASBI_WARN2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.75~I'd steer clear of the valley if I were you.~sl:0.44~Some big hunt going on down there.

NASBI_WARN2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Can't move for flying lead and stampeding buffalo.~sl:0.53~Not worth getting tangled up in, if you ask me.

NASBI_WARN3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.37~Hey, big hunt going on down in the valley,~sl:0.35~so be careful if you're headed that way.
