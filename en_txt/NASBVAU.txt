NASBV_BANT1A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Lord have mercy. Yes.~sl:0.6~That's why the boys all headed upstream.

NASBV_BANT1A_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.5~Alright.~sl:0.8~So... where we headed then?

NASBV_BANT1A_4 = ~z~Where I showed you. On the map.

NASBV_BANT1A_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.6~Oh yeah.~sl:0.7~Right.

NASBV_BANT1B_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Hey, does the boss seem like he's acting strange to you?~sl:~Only giving us part of the map and all.

NASBV_BANT1B_2 = ~z~He don't trust us is all. Can't say I blame him.

NASBV_BANT1B_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~So...~sl:~if we catch this critter ourselves, what do you wanna do?

NASBV_BANT1B_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~What do you mean?~sl:0.7~We go meet the boss and the rest of 'em up river and hand it over.

NASBV_BANT1B_5 = ~z~Yeah... I mean, yeah of course.

NASBV_BANT1C_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Just how far upriver did the boss go?~sl:0.6~Can I see the map again?

NASBV_BANT1C_2 = ~z~Nope.

NASBV_BANT1C_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~What? Why?~sl:0.8~Don't you trust me or something?

NASBV_BANT1C_4 = ~z~Nope. And the boss don't neither.

NASBV_BANT1C_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Ah, go to hell. If we catch this critter, I'll hand it over to the boss myself.~sl:~Now, let's just get there.

NASBV_BANT1D_1 = ~z~~sl:0.3:3.6~If I spend another day standing up to my waist in a river sniffing beaver shit,~sl:~I'm all set to lose my mind.

NASBV_BANT1D_2 = ~z~~sl:0.9:1.9~It's a shifty little varmint that's for damn sure.~sl:0.8~Best hope this hunch of the boss's pays off.

NASBV_BANT1D_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.6~Yeah.~sl:1.1~You got the map?

NASBV_BANT1D_4 = ~z~Yup, right here.

NASBV_BANT1D_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~Let's get on with it then.~sl:~Sooner I'm back in civilisation, the better.

NASBV_BANT1E_1 = ~z~So, what's this tip you and the boss got a hold of?

NASBV_BANT1E_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~We heard some fishermen talking in town last night,~sl:0.7:1.0~sounded like our critter.~sl:0.6~Jet black.

NASBV_BANT1E_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.5~Huh...~sl:0.7~And how do we know where they was when they saw it?

NASBV_BANT1E_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Bought 'em some drinks, convinced 'em we wasn't out to fish their spot.~sl:0.6~Got 'em to mark it on this here map for us.

NASBV_BANT1E_5 = ~z~Hm, you boys is smart, I'll give you that.

NASBV_BANT2B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.8~Not far now.

NASBV_BANT2C_1 = ~z~Is it far?

NASBV_BANT2C_2 = ~z~Nope, be there in no time.

NASBV_BANT3A_1 = ~z~This our critter's work? I can't track for shit.

NASBV_BANT3A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Looks to be... it's a few days old though.~sl:0.7~Keep going.

NASBV_BANT3B_1 = ~z~Looks like a beaver's to me, what do you think?

NASBV_BANT3B_2 = ~z~Yeah I'd say so. Been a while since it was here though.

NASBV_BANT3C_1 = ~z~What do you reckon? That our beaver?

NASBV_BANT3C_2 = ~z~No doubt at all, we're a few days behind this trail though.

NASBV_BANT3D_1 = ~z~This has gotta be a beaver's work right?

NASBV_BANT3D_2 = ~z~Yeah. Big, too. Ain't fresh though.

NASBV_BANT3E_1 = ~z~I'd say this has our critter written all over it.

NASBV_BANT3E_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Could well be, few days old though.~sl:0.5~If it is... we got some ground to cover.

NASBV_BANT4A_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~How long are we going to have to wait for this man?~sl:~When did you send word to them?

NASBV_BANT4A_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~What the hell's got your britches twisted?~sl:0.4~Crazy Mexican... he'll be here.

NASBV_BANT4A_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~I came here to hunt. And to be paid.~sl:~Not to wait for some city-dweller who wants to keep his shoes clean.

NASBV_BANT4A_4 = ~z~Oh, shut up...

NASBV_BANT4B_1 = ~z~~sl:1.0:4.3~Hey, when the boss gets here, let's tell him this is a man-killing beaver.

NASBV_BANT4B_2 = ~z~~sl:2.0:3.7~We'll, uh, tell him it killed Henry. Chewed his head clean off!

NASBV_BANT4B_3 = ~z~~sl:0.4:2.0~He'll believe you, the idiot.~sl:~I bet you a dollar he'll be too scared to look in the cage!

NASBV_BANT4C_1 = ~z~How much do you think your boss will get for our little friend in there?

NASBV_BANT4C_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Plenty, I'd say.~sl:~He ain't much of an outdoorsman, but he can cut a deal.

NASBV_BANT4C_3 = ~z~~sl:0.8~Explains why he's taking so long to get here.

NASBV_CAGE_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Them's some big old teeth you got there, critter...~sl:0.0:2.0~no word of a lie. Gonna take some pulling...~sl:0.6:0.6~I reckon...

NASBV_CAGE_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~I killed me a lot of beavers in my time.~sl:0.0:3.5~When we was boys, we'd put their tails in momma's mangle.~sl:0.0:3.7~And you is the biggest, ugliest beaver I ever did see.

NASBV_DEN1_3 = ~z~You let me live, I don't get involved, I don't say nothing.

NASBV_DEN2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2:3.3~Please! I'll give you what you want.~sl:0.5~The beaver, right? That's what you came for?

NASBV_DEN2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~I got men headed up to Brandywine Drop right now,~sl:0.4~all but certain that's where it's holed up.

NASBV_DEN2_3 = ~z~You do whatever the hell you want. Just... let me go.

NASBV_DEN3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~I can save you one hell of a lot of time tracking it, if you let me live.~sl:0.6~We think it's up by Brandywine Drop.

NASBV_DEN3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~There's men on their way right now.~sl:0.0:2.9~You can sell their hides too for all I care, just...~sl:~let me be.

NASBV_HIDECAGE1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Hey, hey, hey... I surrender.~sl:0.5:1.3~You're here for the beaver, right?~sl:0.6~Alright, I'm gonna tell you where it is, and you're gonna let me go.

NASBV_HIDECAGE1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~We got it caged up, just north of here.~sl:0.7:1.0~Fair warning,~sl:~ain't nothing I can say'll make my boys give up a payday this big.

NASBV_HIDECAGE1_3 = ~z~Now... we square?

NASBV_HIDECAGE2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Don't shoot! I'll tell you where we got the beaver.~sl:0.5:1.4~That's what you came for, ain't it?~sl:0.6~My boys to the north just sent word they got it.

NASBV_HIDECAGE2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~And it's a beauty. But I'll tell you this,~sl:~we spent too long after this pelt for them to just hand it over.

NASBV_HIDECAGE2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You better go ready for a fight.~sl:0.7~Now... just let me walk outta here.

NASBV_HIDECAGE3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Shit, wait, just hear me out!~sl:0.0:2.8~Y-you came for the pelt, right? The beaver?~sl:0.6~My men to the north just sent word they got it.

NASBV_HIDECAGE3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Now, I can't get 'em to just hand it over, but I'll cut you a deal...~sl:0.6~you let me go, I won't warn 'em you're coming.

NASBV_SPARE_01 = ~z~You ain't gonna kill a man over a goddamn beaver!

NASBV_SPARE_02 = ~z~Let me go, I-I said the beaver's yours.

NASBV_SPARE_03 = ~z~I don't wanna die over no damn beaver...

NASBV_SPARE_04 = ~z~You got the beaver, it's all yours, just let me go.
