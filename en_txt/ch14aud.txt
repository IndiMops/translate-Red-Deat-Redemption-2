CCHSH_14_A_1 = ~z~Can I help you?

CCHSH_14_A_2 = ~z~Well, I was wondering if we could help you.

CCHSH_14_A_3 = ~z~How very kind. I think we're okay.

CCHSH_14_A_INT_1 = ~z~Who's this creepy looking fool anyhow?

CCHSH_14_A_INT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Forgive my friend,~sl:0.2:1.2~he's simple minded.~sl:0.2~Dropped on his head as a baby.

CCHSH_14_B_1 = ~z~What are you boys doing here?

CCHSH_14_B_2 = ~z~Traveling.

CCHSH_14_B_3 = ~z~You in a circus?

CCHSH_14_B_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~No sir, we are speculators.~sl:0.2:1.4~We've been out west...~sl:0.3~ain't nothing there no more if truth be told, so...

CCHSH_14_B_INT_1 = ~z~What's wrong with that feller?

CCHSH_14_B_INT_2 = ~z~Like I said, slow in the head.

CCHSH_14_C_1 = ~z~So now you're traveling east?

CCHSH_14_C_2 = ~z~I guess.

CCHSH_14_C_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Well we been hearing talk about problems and,~sl:0.4~well, we've got enough problems of our own here.

CCHSH_14_C_4 = ~z~We don't need no more.

CCHSH_14_C_5 = ~z~Who does, sir? Who does indeed.

CCHSH_14_C_6 = ~z~So I'm guessing we understand one another?

CCHSH_14_C_7 = ~z~I'm hoping so, sir.

CCHSH_14_C_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~You know...~sl:0.3:2.4~many of life's most avoidable tragedies stem~sl:~from our great inability at basic comprehension.

CCHSH_14_C_9 = ~z~Least that's the way I've always seen things.

CCHSH_14_C_10 = ~z~Ah...

CCHSH_14_C_11 = ~z~Goodbye.

CCHSH_14_WNT_A_1 = ~z~Hey, there's some fellers near camp.

CCHSH_14_WNT_A_2 = ~z~Locals?

CCHSH_14_WNT_A_3 = ~z~Not sure.

CCHSH_14_WNT_A_4 = ~z~Let's go see.

CCHSH_14_WNT_B_1 = ~z~What d'you think?

CCHSH_14_WNT_B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Sounds like a lot of bluster to me.~sl:~Nothing we need to worry about too much.

CCHSH_14_WNT_B_3 = ~z~You think they'll cause trouble?

CCHSH_14_WNT_B_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Probably, but not just yet.~sl:1.0~I mean, we always find trouble eventually.

CCHSH_14_WNT_B_5 = ~z~Just what happens before that's interesting.
