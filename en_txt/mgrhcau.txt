0xEB2D4B76 = ~z~Good doing business... as always.

0xFD3FEF9B = ~z~Just follow that, and you will earn your pay.

MGRHC_ACTAGG_01 = ~z~Would you cut that out?

MGRHC_ACTAGG_02 = ~z~Stop that this instant!

MGRHC_ACTAGG_03 = ~z~Enough of that already!

MGRHC_ACTAGG_04 = ~z~We won't have that behavior here.

MGRHC_ACTAGG_05 = ~z~Oh no you don't.

MGRHC_ACTAGG_06 = ~z~Come now. Behave.

MGRHC_AGGRESS_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~If you're gonna behave like that,~sl:~you'll have to look somewhere else for work.

MGRHC_AGGRESS_02 = ~z~After being so rude, you can't expect me to give you any work.

MGRHC_AGGRESS_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~My jobs are for people with manners.~sl:0.5~Good Lord. Please learn some.

MGRHC_APPRCHF_01 = ~z~Pssst. Over here.

MGRHC_APPRCHF_02 = ~z~Remember me?

MGRHC_APPRCHF_03 = ~z~Hello.

MGRHC_APPRCHF_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~You there.

MGRHC_APPRCHF_05 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.5~Mmm.~sl:0.6~Hmm.

MGRHC_APPRCHF_06 = ~z~Fancy seeing you again. Are you in search of employment?

MGRHC_APPRCH_01 = ~z~Well, look who's back.

MGRHC_APPRCH_02 = ~z~Good to see you again.

MGRHC_APPRCH_03 = ~z~We meet again.

MGRHC_APPRCH_04 = ~z~Fancy seeing you here.

MGRHC_APPRCH_05 = ~z~Oh hello.

MGRHC_CE_ABD_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~The state of this part of the country,~sl:0.6:1.3~it's really quite wretched.~sl:0.5~And it's only getting worse.

MGRHC_CE_ABD_2 = ~z~There's no guarantee any of these coaches will get where they're going.

MGRHC_CE_ABD_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~I mean, some stand a better chance than others.~sl:0.3~But that's only 'cause folks like you and I take such a keen interest.

MGRHC_CE_ABD_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~The folks I'm about to introduce you to understand that,~sl:~and they understand it don't come cheaply.

MGRHC_CE_ABD_5 = ~z~Come on. They're heading up to Aberdeen.

MGRHC_CE_BRT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Now, this may go against your natural...~sl:0.7:2.0~predispositions, but~sl:~I need you to avert a robbery rather than perpetrate one today.

MGRHC_CE_BRT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~There's a caravan heading from Rhodes to Braithwaite manor,~sl:~and the good money comes from it not getting held up.

MGRHC_CE_BRT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~You can take care of that, now can't you?~sl:0.4~Okay. Let's get you on the driver's box.

MGRHC_CE_CAR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Today is an opportunity to help others such as ourselves...~sl:1.1~downtrodden souls to whom the world has not been kind.

MGRHC_CE_CAR_2 = ~z~These particular fellows are taking a caravan from Valentine to Carmody Dell,

MGRHC_CE_CAR_3 = ~z~and somewhere along that route they will almost assuredly be held up.

MGRHC_CE_CAR_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~For a generous fee, you will be their protection. Uh huh.~sl:0.6~That's what I thought.

MGRHC_CE_CAR_5 = ~z~Let's get you over there before they go.

MGRHC_CE_EMR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Okay, now these gentlemen have an understanding with our~sl:~“little group”...

MGRHC_CE_EMR_2 = ~z~and I have assured them their caravan will get from Annesburg to Emerald Ranch unmolested.

MGRHC_CE_EMR_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Am I right in thinking you are just the person~sl:~to hold the molesters at bay?

MGRHC_CE_EMR_4 = ~z~I thought so... let's get you right over there.

MGRHC_CE_EMS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Good. Good.~sl:0.5:2.4~When these fellers asked if there was anything special I could do~sl:~to make sure their caravan got to Emerald Ranch,

MGRHC_CE_EMS_2 = ~z~I almost slapped them. I mean, what are they implying?

MGRHC_CE_EMS_3 = ~z~But I calmed myself, and said I might know someone who could offer some protection.

MGRHC_CE_EMS_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~They're leaving from Van Horn soon.~sl:0.3~Come along, and I'll make the introductions.

MGRHC_CE_LAG_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Well, here it is...~sl:0.5:3.1~I can guarantee certain coaches won't get where they're going,~sl:~but I cannot guarantee they will.

MGRHC_CE_LAG_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Which is where you come in.~sl:0.5~I got a caravan heading from Rhodes to Lagras that has got to get there.

MGRHC_CE_LAG_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~So you are going to jump up on the driver's box and try and make sure of that.~sl:0.9~Okay. Come on.

MGRHC_CE_MAC_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Now, this is a personal favor.~sl:0.6~One that you will be paid for of course.

MGRHC_CE_MAC_2 = ~z~My foolish superiors have become agitated by all these robberies on my routes...

MGRHC_CE_MAC_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~and I fear that if this next caravan does not get where it's going...~sl:~from Van Horn to some place in the Heartlands...

MGRHC_CE_MAC_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~I will be blamed. Ensure it gets there, okay?~sl:0.7:0.7~For me.~sl:0.7~Now, come along.

MGRHC_CE_RHO_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~You are in luck...~sl:0.3~there is a caravan of goods moving from Valentine to Rhodes,

MGRHC_CE_RHO_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~and the fools running it will pay more for its protection~sl:~than it could ever be worth.

MGRHC_CE_RHO_3 = ~z~Come along now, I will make the introductions.

MGRHC_CE_VET_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~You know, I could not care a fig for most of the cargo that goes through here...~sl:1.0~but these fellers... they're like us, understand?

MGRHC_CE_VET_2 = ~z~Misused... so, I said I would help them get their things up to where they was going.

MGRHC_CE_VET_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Can you help them get to where they're going?~sl:0.6~Okay then, let me get you to them.

MGRHC_CE_VET_4 = ~z~The destination's by O'Creagh's Run.

MGRHC_DM_RHOA_1 = ~z~Well, okay. We got some deliveries need making.

MGRHC_DM_RHOA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~This is the kind of drudgery they hope will soften our minds,~sl:~but you and me are smarter than that.

MGRHC_DM_RHOA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Discouraged, but undiminished. Yes indeed.~sl:~The bags are outside, just take them where they need to go.

MGRHC_DM_RHOA_4 = ~z~Take their money, but don't let them take your pride.

MGRHC_DM_RHOA_5 = ~z~Go and grab them now. Good luck.

MGRHC_DM_RHOB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Well, there are some things to deliver.~sl:~Might keep you occupied until something more interesting comes along.

MGRHC_DM_RHOB_2 = ~z~Just... see if there's any bags out the side, and take them where they need to go.

MGRHC_DM_RHOB_3 = ~z~Good luck. And come see me again soon.

MGRHC_DM_VALA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Alright, well, let's see now.~sl:0.5~I thought I had something better, but really it's just post bags.

MGRHC_DM_VALA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Just go take a look around the back, and any bag you find,~sl:~you take it where it's going.

MGRHC_DM_VALA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Not particularly glamorous, but~sl:~someone's gotta be paid for it, it may as well be you.

MGRHC_DM_VALA_4 = ~z~Just round the back. So long then.

MGRHC_DM_VALB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Let's see then. Let's see.~sl:0.7:0.6~I thought...~sl:0.6~no, it's just some mail I'm afraid.

MGRHC_DM_VALB_2 = ~z~Take a look around the side and see if there's some bags there.

MGRHC_DM_VALB_3 = ~z~Whatever you find, take to the address that's marked on them, and that... is the job.

MGRHC_DM_VALB_4 = ~z~You'll be paid more than a postman though, I can assure you that.

MGRHC_DM_VALB_5 = ~z~Neither snow nor rain, remember.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Well, here it is, the whole mail system has ground to a halt~sl:~and “the powers that be” are willing to pay top dollar for a private solution.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~There'll be a few deliveries to make from any of the bags...~sl:~but I'm sure you're more than capable.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Don't say Alden doesn't look after you.~sl:0.6~So long now.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~It's, umm, well...~sl:0.4~it's some mail that needs to be delivered.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOB_2 = ~z~All our postmen been taken down with a case of the runs, and they need someone to fill in.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Just pick up any bag that's out there, and take the letters in it where they need to go.~sl:0.4~It'll all be around Scarlett Meadows.

MGRHC_DRM_RHOB_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Sooner it's done, sooner I can get you your payment.~sl:0.4~Bye for now.

MGRHC_DR_ANNA_1 = ~z~I should say, there ain't much work going, but we do have some mail needs delivered...

MGRHC_DR_ANNA_2 = ~z~a few addresses around Roanoke Ridge... it ain't exactly befitting as proud a specimen as you... but it pays okay.

MGRHC_DR_ANNA_3 = ~z~You'll find the mail over back there. Go grab them. Good luck.

MGRHC_DR_ANNB_1 = ~z~Okay, well, we do have some mail in need of delivery.

MGRHC_DR_ANNB_2 = ~z~It's hard to find folks who'll take it up to those hills, and hollers, and hillbillies.

MGRHC_DR_ANNB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~But I'm guessing you don't mind getting dirty occasionally... none of us do.~sl:0.6~The bag is just around the side there.

MGRHC_DR_ANNB_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~'Round the side. Look after yourself.~sl:1.0~So long.

MGRHC_ESCALATE_01 = ~z~Stop that right now!

MGRHC_ESCALATE_02 = ~z~You've taken this too far.

MGRHC_ESCALATE_03 = ~z~You are causing a scene!

MGRHC_ESCALATE_04 = ~z~Please. Enough of this!

MGRHC_ESCALATE_05 = ~z~Are you done yet?

MGRHC_G1_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~I have a job for you alright? Only...~sl:0.7~you never know who's listening.

MGRHC_G1_OUT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~It's all written down on this paper here.~sl:0.5~Carry out those instructions, and you'll be paid... handsomely.

MGRHC_G1_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Okay. Just... have a read and get it done.~sl:0.8~There's fine friend.

MGRHC_G2_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Fine thing. This is a job that will require some discretion.~sl:0.5~Something you and I understand only too well, I'm sure.

MGRHC_G2_OUT_2 = ~z~I have it all written down here. Just take this paper.

MGRHC_G2_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~Should all be clear when you read that.~sl:0.6~Don't lose it now.

MGRHC_G3_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Can you keep a secret? I'm all secrets, me.~sl:~Tell me something, and I won't tell a soul.

MGRHC_G3_OUT_2 = ~z~Discretion is an undervalued quality, particularly nowadays.

MGRHC_G3_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Very good. Get that done and you'll be paid. And remember...~sl:0.3:2.4~seal those lips with a lock and key.

MGRHC_G4_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Let me see now. I can just give you the bill, and you can just carry it out.~sl:~How about that?

MGRHC_G4_OUT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Saves me explaining it all.~sl:0.5~We're both far too busy to waste time with that, now aren't we?

MGRHC_G4_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Should be simple enough. Get it done and I'll organize your pay.~sl:0.6~Busy bee, off you go.

MGRHC_G5_OUT_1 = ~z~This should be easy, and you can get started right away because...

MGRHC_G5_OUT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~your instructions are all written down on this piece of paper here...~sl:0.3~take it.

MGRHC_G5_TAKE_1 = ~z~Just follow that, and you will earn your pay.

MGRHC_G5_TAKE_2 = ~z~Good doing business... as always.

MGRHC_GREET1_01 = ~z~Why hello.

MGRHC_GREET1_02 = ~z~Hello there.

MGRHC_GREET1_03 = ~z~My dear friend.

MGRHC_IDLE_TIME_02 = ~z~You are leaving this awfully late.

MGRHC_IDLE_TIME_03 = ~z~If you're going to do it, you better do it now.

MGRHC_IDLE_TIME_04 = ~z~If you're actually going to do this, you better go.

MGRHC_IDLE_TIME_05 = ~z~Last chance... leave now or you're too late.

MGRHC_LEAVECLM_01 = ~z~Come on. Time for you to go.

MGRHC_LEAVECLM_02 = ~z~Erm... I guess I'll be seeing ya.

MGRHC_LEAVECLM_03 = ~z~If you don't mind, I have work to finish.

MGRHC_LEAVECLM_04 = ~z~Why don't you leave me to it, then?

MGRHC_LEAVECLM_05 = ~z~If that's all, would you mind leaving me to conduct my business?

MGRHC_LEAVE_01 = ~z~You need to get outta here!

MGRHC_LEAVE_02 = ~z~You need to go!

MGRHC_LEAVE_03 = ~z~That's it, go!

MGRHC_LEAVE_04 = ~z~Now can you leave, please?

MGRHC_LEAVE_05 = ~z~I want you to leave!

MGRHC_REC_BIGV_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Okay, then... okay. This will put my mind at rest, at least.~sl:0.6~I have been fearing the worst.

MGRHC_REC_BIGV_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~A driver up in Big Valley should have been back days ago.~sl:0.5~If the cart was stolen, we'd usually heard of something by now.

MGRHC_REC_BIGV_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Gives me the willies. Can you find the cart, bring it back, and...~sl:~try and find out what happened, okay?

MGRHC_REC_BIGV_4 = ~z~Thank you. Good luck. And try to stay safe.

MGRHC_REC_CROPA_1 = ~z~It's, umm, well... another stage coach.

MGRHC_REC_CROPA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~I was going to give you a tip about it,~sl:~but someone might have beaten us to the punch.

MGRHC_REC_CROPA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~It's gone missing on the road into town.~sl:0.5~Silver lining to this cloud is: there might be reward money for its return.

MGRHC_REC_CROPA_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You think you can go and find it and bring it in?~sl:0.7~I'm sure you can.

MGRHC_REC_CROPA_5 = ~z~I'm rooting for you. Bonne chance now.

MGRHC_REC_CROPB_1 = ~z~It's, umm, well... a goods cart.

MGRHC_REC_CROPB_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~I was going to give you a tip about it,~sl:~but someone might have beaten us to the punch.

MGRHC_REC_SWHA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~As you may know, I am not in the habit of losing stage coaches...~sl:0.5~even when I have lost actually them.

MGRHC_REC_SWHA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~But this one has positively disappeared.~sl:0.5~Last seen in the region of some rather uncouth types to the north of here, so...

MGRHC_REC_SWHA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~probably they were involved.~sl:0.5~Now, my friend, if you can get it back, they'll be good money for you.

MGRHC_REC_SWHA_4 = ~z~There's a dear. You haven't a moment to lose. Get after 'em.

MGRHC_REC_SWHB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~As you may know, I am not in the habit of losing my drivers...~sl:0.5~even when I have actually lost them.

MGRHC_REC_SWHB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~probably they were involved.~sl:0.5~Now, my friend, if you can get that wagon back, they'll be good money for you.

MGRHC_REC_SWHB_4 = ~z~There's a dear. You haven't a moment to lose. Get after 'em.

MGRHC_REC_VANA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I'll tell you something, I do not like these swamps.~sl:~Not one bit. Mud everywhere.

MGRHC_REC_VANA_2 = ~z~I prefer to stay clean, myself... as I'm sure do you too.

MGRHC_REC_VANA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~We had a stage coming through Bluewater Marsh.~sl:0.6~I'm hoping it's just stuck somewhere, but we need someone to check.

MGRHC_REC_VANA_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Can you take a look out there, and bring it back in if you find it?~sl:0.5~Okay.

MGRHC_REC_VANA_5 = ~z~Very good now. And get yourself a bath when you're done.

MGRHC_REC_VANB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I'll tell you something, I do not like these swamps.~sl:~Not one bit. Mud everywhere.

MGRHC_REC_WHRA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~How well do you know the plains down there?~sl:0.7~I booked a stage through there and it has not come in.

MGRHC_REC_WHRA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~I thought it was just grazing land, but maybe...~sl:0.6~there's still some uncouth elements about.

MGRHC_REC_WHRA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Such a shame. Would you go take a look?~sl:0.5~And bring in our coach if you see it?

MGRHC_REC_WHRA_4 = ~z~There's a dear. Good on ya.

MGRHC_REC_WHRB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~How well do you know the plains down there?~sl:0.7~I booked a wagon through there and it has not come in.

MGRHC_REC_WHRB_4 = ~z~There's a dear. Good on ya.

MGRHC_RS_BUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Well, we got a driver feeling poorly, ~sl:~so you could take his wagon up there to Butcher's Creek.

MGRHC_RS_BUT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Ain't nice country, so I can't promise it'll be a pleasant ride,~sl:~but, then, you're braver than me...

MGRHC_RS_BUT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~even if we are alike in other...~sl:0.5:1.8~respects. Aren't we?~sl:0.6~Now, come on.

MGRHC_RS_EMR_1 = ~z~This is a hairy one, I'm afraid. And not hairy in a nice way.

MGRHC_RS_EMR_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~We have a wagon that needs to get up to Emerald Ranch...~sl:~and there are some bad elements on the road.

MGRHC_RS_EMR_3 = ~z~Not many of our drivers will touch this route anymore, but I know you're different.

MGRHC_RS_EMR_4 = ~z~Okay, I'll get you over there.

MGRHC_RS_VAL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You heard about the Valentine road?~sl:0.5~Been having all kinds of trouble sending wagons over there.

MGRHC_RS_VAL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Most of the regular drivers are refusing to take that route...~sl:~but then their pay is fixed.

MGRHC_RS_VAL_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~And yours... we can bump up a little. A little and then some.~sl:~I'll get you over to the vehicle right away.

MGRHC_RS_VET_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.1~I was worried about you, you know. Always worrying, I am. It's my curse.~sl:0.5~And now this will make me worry even more.

MGRHC_RS_VET_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~A wagon needs taking up to O'Creagh's Run.~sl:~But you don't wanna let my fussing get in the way of your earnings...

MGRHC_RS_VET_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~so I'll just get you over to it...~sl:0.5~promise to look out for bandits though, okay? Good.

MGRHC_RW_BEH_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Okay. There is a very interesting wagon up at Beaver Hollow.~sl:0.5~Very interesting indeed.

MGRHC_RW_BEH_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Folks up there ain't nice, but.. well, who is?~sl:0.5~Go get that wagon and... I would try not to kill any of 'em.

MGRHC_RW_BEH_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Good luck.~sl:0.7~I mean that.

MGRHC_RW_ECU_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Did I say I had something?~sl:0.7~I'm sorry, I was mistaken.

MGRHC_RW_ECU_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~I was going to tell you about a coach heading through Cumberland Forest...~sl:0.6~a coach that would be a prize to any highwayman...

MGRHC_RW_ECU_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~but if I told you about that, some folk might think I was telling you to rob it.~sl:~And I am not telling you to do that.

MGRHC_RW_ECU_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~You understand? Don't rob it,~sl:0.6~but if you do, don't kill anyone.

MGRHC_RW_ECU_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Good day.~sl:0.4~So long.

MGRHC_RW_GEN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~Oh, I'm sorry. I can't talk right now. I gotta go write up this wagon...~sl:0.5~carrying all kinds of valuable cargo.

MGRHC_RW_GEN_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~I gotta make sure it's all well-documented,~sl:0.0:2.4~so if something happened to it, God forbid,~sl:~there could be a claim with the insurance company.

MGRHC_RW_GEN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~We wouldn't want anything to happen to it, now would we?~sl:0.7~Quite right.

MGRHC_RW_GEN_4 = ~z~Go quick, now. And please don't kill anybody.

MGRHC_TAKEP_01 = ~z~Take it.

MGRHC_TAKEP_02 = ~z~It's there.

MGRHC_WT_BRT_2 = ~z~Nope, these fools do not have my blessing.

MGRHC_WT_BRT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Now, if you could get that property back,~sl:~I'm sure I could arrange a healthy reward from the company.

MGRHC_WT_BRT_4 = ~z~It all took place on the road south of here, so that's where I'd start.

MGRHC_WT_CBF_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~They got it coming through Cumberland Forest,~sl:0.1~so, if you head up there now, you might find them in time.

MGRHC_WT_CBF_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~You get it back, there'll be money waiting for you.~sl:0.5~Move your behind, already.

MGRHC_WT_GRZ_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Did you hear? We lost a caravan.~sl:0.3~Up in the mountains, west of here.

MGRHC_WT_GRZ_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~I know it wasn't you... or any of our like, for that matter.~sl:0.5~These were men without refinement.

MGRHC_WT_GRZ_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~So could you, uh... head up there and be rough with'em?~sl:0.5~Bring us our goods back? You are a treasure.

MGRHC_WT_GRZ_4 = ~z~That's the spirit. The reward will be waiting for ya.

MGRHC_WT_SAN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Okay. Now, I know what you're going to think.~sl:0.5~"Alden tipped off these robbers, and now he's turned on'em."

MGRHC_WT_SAN_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~But it isn't like that at all.~sl:0.5:1.8~These thieves are bullies...~sl:0.3~and not downtrodden and discouraged one little bit.

MGRHC_WT_SAN_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~So when they hijack a caravan of ours,~sl:0.2~I'm sending someone after'em. And that someone is you.

MGRHC_WT_SAN_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You understand? Okay.~sl:0.5~They were on the road coming into town.

MGRHC_WT_SMWA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~You might be able to turn my day around.~sl:0.5~I woke up sour and it's only got worse.

MGRHC_WT_SMWA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~We were expecting a caravan... from up at Flatneck Station,~sl:~but from the sounds of it, it's been robbed.

MGRHC_WT_SMWA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~If you can head up that way and bring it in, well...~sl:0.3~I'll be happier and you'll be richer.

MGRHC_WT_SMWA_4 = ~z~Go on, then. I live in hope.

MGRHC_WT_SMWB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~You might be able to turn my day around.~sl:0.3~I woke up sour and it's only got worse.

MGRHC_WT_SMWB_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~We were expecting a caravan... from up at Emerald Station,~sl:~but from the sound of it, it's been robbed.

MGRHC_WT_SMWB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~If you can head up that way and bring it in, well...~sl:0.2~I'll be happier and you'll be richer.

MGRHC_WT_VAN_3 = ~z~And maybe that would be of interest to you? I thought it might.

MGRHC_WT_VAN_4 = ~z~Okay. Off you go.

MGRHC_WT_VAN_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Like I said, it was up on Roanoke Ridge.~sl:0.3~Bring it in and you'll be paid.

RHC_ACCEPT_02 = ~z~Well... so long.

RHC_ACCEPT_03 = ~z~You should be getting along.

RHC_ACCEPT_05 = ~z~You aren't going to solve anything staying here.

RHC_AIM_01 = ~z~Watch where you're aiming that!

RHC_AIM_02 = ~z~Put it away!

RHC_AIM_03 = ~z~Put it down!

RHC_AIM_04 = ~z~Put it back in your pants.

RHC_AIM_05 = ~z~Be careful with that.

RHC_APPROACH_01 = ~z~Can I interest you in some business?

RHC_APPROACH_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~I might have something you could...~sl:0.6~occupy yourself with, you know.

RHC_BOUNTY_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~What would folks say if they saw me doing business with an outlaw? Really.~sl:0.5~Can you pay off that bounty please?

RHC_COOLDOWN_01 = ~z~I can't talk to you right now.

RHC_FAILED_LM_01 = ~z~Good to see you back. That last one didn't go so good, now did it?

RHC_FAIL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~That wasn't very good now was it?~sl:~You didn't manage to pull that one off.

RHC_FAIL_02 = ~z~Well, that did not go to plan. So much for that job.

RHC_FAIL_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Oh Lord...~sl:0.5~I guess you're not getting paid for that.

RHC_H_LOW_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I can't give any work to... someone like you.~sl:0.4~What would the company think?

RHC_H_LOW_02 = ~z~I am sure you're a lovely person... but it just wouldn't look right giving work to someone with your... morals.

RHC_H_LOW_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.9~Let's be frank... you are a nasty piece of work. And while I don't judge, others do.~sl:~It wouldn't look right us working together.

RHC_M_COOLDOWN_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~I like your eagerness. But I think we should leave it a while before doing anything else.~sl:~Don't want to arise suspicions.

RHC_NOT_GL_03 = ~z~I would feel more comfortable addressing the leader of this outfit...

RHC_NO_AVAIL_01 = ~z~I don't have anything for you right now, I'm afraid.

RHC_PUSH_01 = ~z~What are you doing?

RHC_PUSH_02 = ~z~Would you stop?
