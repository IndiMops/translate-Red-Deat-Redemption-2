ABI1_ABDWDLE_01 = ~z~Please? Arthur, the boy's been through a lot.

ABI1_ABDWDLE_02 = ~z~He's playing over by the horses.

ABI1_ABDWDLE_03 = ~z~Just go check on him, it would mean a lot to me.

ABI1_AFISH2_1 = ~z~Now, to cast your line, swing the rod back over your shoulder,

ABI1_AFISH2_2 = ~z~and bring it forward in a smooth motion.

ABI1_AFISH2_3 = ~z~Use your wrist, not your elbow.

ABI1_ARRIVE_1 = ~z~Alright, this looks as good a spot as any.

ABI1_ARTFOLLO_01 = ~z~Why don't you get your horse ready for us, Uncle Arthur?

ABI1_ARTFOLLO_02 = ~z~I can get it by myself.

ABI1_ASETOFFC_01 = ~z~Alright, hold on tight.

ABI1_ASETOFFC_02 = ~z~Alright, let's go then.

ABI1_BKTOCAMP_1 = ~z~Why did you lie about where Uncle Dutch is?

ABI1_BKTOCAMP_2 = ~z~Because... ~rp~well ~rp~because those are disagreeable men ~rp~and I don't want them to hurt him.

ABI1_BKTOCAMP_3 = ~z~What did they mean about Mac? Is he in jail?

ABI1_DAWDLEJ_03 = ~z~Are you taking me back?

ABI1_DEADFISH_01 = ~z~Looks like we held onto this one too long, sorry little feller.

ABI1_DEADFISH_02 = ~z~Oops, held on to that one a little too long.

ABI1_FISHTALK2_2 = ~z~I think so. This is hard.

ABI1_FISHTALK3_1 = ~z~Why am I not catching any?

ABI1_FISHTALK3_2 = ~z~Just be patient.

ABI1_FISHTALK4_1 = ~z~My arms are tired.

ABI1_FISHTALK4_2 = ~z~You're alright.

ABI1_IG2_4 = ~z~I guess...

ABI1_IG2_5 = ~z~You wanna come fishing with me?

ABI1_IG2_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~Sure.~sl:0.2~You're...

ABI1_IG2_8 = ~z~It's about time that you started to earn your keep.

ABI1_IG2_9 = ~z~Okay.

ABI1_IG2_10 = ~z~Good.

ABI1_IG2_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0~Let's go get your pole then.~sl:~Now you do have a fishing pole, don't you?

ABI1_IG2_12 = ~z~I sure do.

ABI1_IG2_13 = ~z~Uncle Hosea made me one.

ABI1_IG2_14 = ~z~Good. Well let's go get it then.

ABI1_IG2_15 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3:1~And go catch us some fish!

ABI1_IG2_16 = ~z~Yeah!

ABI1_JAKFAST1_1 = ~z~Ride fast, Uncle Arthur.

ABI1_JAKFAST1_2 = ~z~Alright.

ABI1_JAKFAST2_1 = ~z~Go fast, like the last time.

ABI1_JFISH1A_1 = ~z~I'm gonna use some cheese.

ABI1_JFISH1A_2 = ~z~Cheese?

ABI1_JFISH1A_3 = ~z~Smellier the better.

ABI1_JFISH1_1 = ~z~First we need some bait.

ABI1_JFISH2_1 = ~z~Like that?

ABI1_JFISH2_2 = ~z~That's it, good.

ABI1_JFISH3_1 = ~z~All we do now, Jack, is wait for a fish to take the bait.

ABI1_JFISH4_01 = ~z~I'm going to try my luck over there.

ABI1_JFISH4_02 = ~z~You see that cast, Jack?

ABI1_JFISH4_03 = ~z~Alright, let's see what's biting there.

ABI1_JFISH4_04 = ~z~Let's try again.

ABI1_JFISH4_05 = ~z~I like the look of that spot.

ABI1_JFISH5_1 = ~z~How do I know when I've got a bite?

ABI1_JFISH5_2 = ~z~Well, if you feel the tip of your fishing rod just... twitching? Don't yank it yet, that just means one's nibbling.

ABI1_JFISH5_3 = ~z~But if you feel a hard tug, that's a fish going for the bait, so yank hard to hook it.

ABI1_JFISH6_01 = ~z~Didn't hook him!

ABI1_JFISH6_02 = ~z~Missed him! That's just a part of fishing, Jack.

ABI1_JFISH6_03 = ~z~Damn it. Didn't get him.

ABI1_JFISH6_04 = ~z~Ignore that one, Jack, that was my mistake.

ABI1_JFISH6_05 = ~z~Too slow there.

ABI1_JFISH7_01 = ~z~Got one, Jack!

ABI1_JFISH7_02 = ~z~There we go!

ABI1_JFISH7_03 = ~z~Fish on the line!

ABI1_JFISH7_04 = ~z~There, got him!

ABI1_JFISH9_01 = ~z~Aw no.

ABI1_JFISH9_03 = ~z~Uncle Arthur!

ABI1_JFISH10_01 = ~z~I see, I see!

ABI1_JFISH10_02 = ~z~Is it a big one?

ABI1_JFISH10_03 = ~z~Pull him in!

ABI1_JFISH11_01 = ~z~There! I can see a fish!

ABI1_JFISH11_02 = ~z~I see lots of fishes in there.

ABI1_JFISH11_03 = ~z~I see them all swimming around!

ABI1_JFISH11_04 = ~z~Look at all those fish, Uncle Arthur!

ABI1_JFISH11_05 = ~z~I just saw a big one!

ABI1_JFISH12_1 = ~z~See him fighting there, Jack? That's when you gotta be careful or you'll break the line.

ABI1_JFISH12_2 = ~z~Best to wear him out first before you try'n reel him in.

ABI1_JFISH13_1 = ~z~Seems like he's taking a rest now I'm gonna try reeling him in nice and steady.

ABI1_JNECKL1_1 = ~z~Can I take a break from fishing? I want to make something.

ABI1_JRDANGER_01 = ~z~That thing is very close to us.

ABI1_JRDANGER_03 = ~z~Momma told me to stay away from those.

ABI1_JRSLOWRD_01 = ~z~Are we ever going to get there?

ABI1_JRSLOWRD_02 = ~z~This is taking ages!

ABI1_JRSLOWRD_03 = ~z~How far are we going?

ABI1_MOUNTUP_1 = ~z~I'll mount up and lift you on when you're ready.

ABI1_NECKL1_1 = ~z~You gotta stick at things, Jack.

ABI1_NECKL1_2 = ~z~I know.

ABI1_NECKL2_1 = ~z~What you making there?

ABI1_NECKL2_2 = ~z~You'll see. It's a surprise.

ABI1_NECKL3_1 = ~z~You still alright over there?

ABI1_OUTBNT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Just down to the river near here.~sl:~We shouldn't go too far from camp.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_3 = ~z~Oh, okay.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_4 = ~z~You feeling better? I know you was a little sick.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_5 = ~z~Oh, I'm fine.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_6 = ~z~You're a brave kid.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_7 = ~z~So just like you.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_8 = ~z~Well, I don't know about brave... I ain't much of a kid no more.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_9 = ~z~Though your momma might disagree.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_10 = ~z~Her and a few other women, I guess...

ABI1_OUTBNT1_11 = ~z~What do you mean?

ABI1_OUTBNT1_12 = ~z~~sl:0.6~I'm just talking silly... it's been a tough few weeks up in that snow.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_13 = ~z~I liked the snow.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_14 = ~z~Yes, but not like that.

ABI1_OUTBNT1_15 = ~z~When are we going back to the other camp?

ABI1_RSC2_36 = ~z~Oh, ain't that a little...

ABI1_RSC2_37 = ~z~old fashioned nowadays?

ABI1_RSC2_49 = ~z~from Mac Callander.

ABI1_RSC2_50 = ~z~Mac Callander?

ABI1_RSC2_51 = ~z~He was pretty shot up by the time I got to him...

ABI1_RSC2_52 = ~z~so really it was more of a mercy killing.

ABI1_RSC2_53 = ~z~Slow...

ABI1_RSC2_54 = ~z~but merciful.

ABI1_RSC2_55 = ~z~You enjoy being a rich man's toy do you?

ABI1_RSC2_56 = ~z~I enjoy society...

ABI1_RSC2_57 = ~z~flaws and all.

ABI1_RSC4_43 = ~z~We just need to stay calm.

ABI1_RSC4_LEAD_1 = ~z~There you are!

ABI1_RSC4_LEAD_2 = ~z~How you boys getting on?

ABI1_RSC_1_1 = ~z~Can I ask you a favor?

ABI1_RSC_1_2 = ~z~Probably not...

ABI1_RSC_1_3 = ~z~Very funny.

ABI1_RSC_1_4 = ~z~Would you do something with Jack?

ABI1_RSC_1_5 = ~z~He seems kind of down.

ABI1_RSC_1_6 = ~z~All this upheaval can't have been easy on the poor kid.

ABI1_RSC_1_7 = ~z~Why?

ABI1_RSC_1_8 = ~z~Because I'm your preferred nursemaid?

ABI1_RSC_1_9 = ~z~Because he likes you and, well...

ABI1_RSC_1_10 = ~z~you know his father's useless.
