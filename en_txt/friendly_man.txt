0x057EF42B = ~z~Looks like a good one.

0x5C45FE38 = ~z~I ain't selling nothing. Just being neighborly, mister. It's the way I am.

0x433B6FA3 = ~z~Fine eye, mister.

0x533A786B = ~z~With this plant. Burdock. I use the roots to make medicine for my horse. It's better than anything you'll buy in those fancy catalogues.

0x3413C769 = ~z~Oh, oh please! I don't do well like this!

0x6711C52D = ~z~Look at that. The feeling's mutual, partner.

0x50125CCF = ~z~Why, hey there!

0xF0324738 = ~z~Well, I say why buy it off the shelves when you can make your own?

0xF2FD67D3 = ~z~Yup, you don't find this every day. Dose of this in your medicine, give it some zip, believe me.

0xF226AC37 = ~z~Just a friendly tip, man to man. Nothing more, nothing less.

0xFBA32AFE = ~z~Anyway, I ain't gonna use all of this, so, feel free to help yourself to whatever's left. You take care now.
