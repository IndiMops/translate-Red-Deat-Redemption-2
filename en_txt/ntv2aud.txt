NTV2_CHR_DWDL_02 = ~z~We need to move!

NTV2_CHR_DWDL_03 = ~z~Arthur! Let's go!

NTV2_DAWDLE_01 = ~z~Mr. Morgan, it's time.

NTV2_DAWDLE_02 = ~z~Hurry, I don't think we should keep them waiting.

NTV2_DAWDLE_03 = ~z~Come on, we should get started.

NTV2_DAWDLE_04 = ~z~Over this way. Is there a problem, Mr Morgan?

NTV2_ENEMY_01 = ~z~They're coming after us!

NTV2_ENEMY_02 = ~z~We got some on our tail!

NTV2_ENEMY_03 = ~z~Look out behind, they're catching up!

NTV2_ENEMY_END_01 = ~z~More behind us!

NTV2_ESCFIR_1 = ~z~Open fire on them!

NTV2_ESCREM_01 = ~z~Arthur, let's go!

NTV2_ESCREM_02 = ~z~We need to leave now.

NTV2_ESCREM_03 = ~z~Time to get out of here, come on.

NTV2_ESCSUR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Do it! Shoot him!~sl:1.1~Don't let him get away!

NTV2_EXT_1 = ~z~Get out of here, Captain Monroe.

NTV2_EXT_2 = ~z~I fear it may be Mr. Monroe from now on.

NTV2_EXT_3 = ~z~I'm sorry about your career.

NTV2_EXT_4 = ~z~Here.

NTV2_EXT_5 = ~z~Here's some money.

NTV2_EXT_6 = ~z~You take it and get out of here, and...

NTV2_EXT_7 = ~z~start a new life somewhere.

NTV2_EXT_8 = ~z~I hear Tahiti's nice.

NTV2_EXT_9 = ~z~Thank you.

NTV2_EXT_10 = ~z~Just hop on a train to Saint Denis, jump on a boat...

NTV2_EXT_11 = ~z~But avoid Guarma.

NTV2_EXT_12 = ~z~Where?

NTV2_EXT_13 = ~z~Forget about it.

NTV2_EXT_14 = ~z~Meet you back at camp.

NTV2_EXT_15 = ~z~Mr. Morgan...

NTV2_EXT_16 = ~z~Meet me at the reservation.

NTV2_EXT_17 = ~z~are you okay?

NTV2_EXT_18 = ~z~Never better.

NTV2_EXT_19 = ~z~What are you doing here?

NTV2_EXT_20 = ~z~Well, I'm on my way down to Mexico...

NTV2_EXT_21 = ~z~they're finally sending me on a mission.

NTV2_EXT_22 = ~z~Brother Dorkins is very jealous.

NTV2_EXT_23 = ~z~What's wrong?

NTV2_EXT_24 = ~z~I'm, uh...

NTV2_EXT_25 = ~z~I'm dying, Sister.

NTV2_EXT_26 = ~z~Okay...

NTV2_EXT_27 = ~z~Yeah, I got TB.

NTV2_EXT_28 = ~z~I got it...

NTV2_EXT_29 = ~z~beating a man...

NTV2_EXT_30 = ~z~to death...

NTV2_EXT_31 = ~z~for a few bucks.

NTV2_EXT_32 = ~z~I've lived a bad life, Sister.

NTV2_EXT_33 = ~z~We've all lived bad lives, Mr. Morgan...

NTV2_EXT_34 = ~z~we all sin...

NTV2_EXT_35 = ~z~but I know you.

NTV2_EXT_36 = ~z~You don't know me.

NTV2_EXT_37 = ~z~Forgive me, but...

NTV2_EXT_38 = ~z~that's the problem.

NTV2_EXT_39 = ~z~You don't know you.

NTV2_EXT_40 = ~z~What you mean?

NTV2_EXT_41 = ~z~I don't know, but...

NTV2_EXT_42 = ~z~whenever we happen to meet, you're always helping people and smiling.

NTV2_EXT_43 = ~z~I had a son...

NTV2_EXT_44 = ~z~he passed away.

NTV2_EXT_45 = ~z~I had a girl who loved me...

NTV2_EXT_46 = ~z~I threw that away.

NTV2_EXT_47 = ~z~My momma died when I was a kid...

NTV2_EXT_48 = ~z~and my daddy...

NTV2_EXT_49 = ~z~well, I watched him die...

NTV2_EXT_50 = ~z~and it weren't soon enough.

NTV2_EXT_51 = ~z~My husband died a long time ago.

NTV2_EXT_52 = ~z~Life is full of pain...

NTV2_EXT_53 = ~z~but there is also love and beauty.

NTV2_EXT_54 = ~z~What am I gonna do now?

NTV2_EXT_55 = ~z~Be grateful that for the first time...

NTV2_EXT_56 = ~z~you see your life clearly.

NTV2_EXT_57 = ~z~Sure.

NTV2_EXT_58 = ~z~Perhaps you could help somebody?

NTV2_EXT_59 = ~z~Helping makes you really happy.

NTV2_EXT_60 = ~z~But...

NTV2_EXT_61 = ~z~I still don't believe in nothing.

NTV2_EXT_62 = ~z~Often neither do I...

NTV2_EXT_63 = ~z~but then, I meet someone like you...

NTV2_EXT_64 = ~z~and everything makes sense.

NTV2_EXT_65 = ~z~You're too smart for me, Sister...

NTV2_EXT_66 = ~z~I guess I...

NTV2_EXT_67 = ~z~I'm afraid.

NTV2_EXT_68 = ~z~There is nothing to be afraid of, Mr. Morgan.

NTV2_EXT_69 = ~z~Take a gamble that love exists...

NTV2_EXT_70 = ~z~and do a loving act.

NTV2_EXT_71 = ~z~All aboard!

NTV2_EXT_72 = ~z~I shall try.

NTV2_EXT_73 = ~z~I know you will.

NTV2_EXT_74 = ~z~Meet you back at camp.

NTV2_EXT_75 = ~z~Meet me at the reservation.

NTV2_EXT_76 = ~z~Reverend?

NTV2_EXT_77 = ~z~Reverend...

NTV2_EXT_78 = ~z~what are you doing here?

NTV2_EXT_79 = ~z~I'm leaving.

NTV2_EXT_80 = ~z~Running away?

NTV2_EXT_81 = ~z~Yeah, I suppose so, I'm...

NTV2_EXT_82 = ~z~I'm running away.

NTV2_EXT_83 = ~z~I-I tried to make Dutch see sense but he's...

NTV2_EXT_84 = ~z~very strange, recently.

NTV2_EXT_85 = ~z~And the women? Little Jack?

NTV2_EXT_86 = ~z~You're leaving them?

NTV2_EXT_87 = ~z~I told them to run, too...

NTV2_EXT_88 = ~z~I asked them to come with me and they wouldn't.

NTV2_EXT_89 = ~z~I've changed...

NTV2_EXT_90 = ~z~I'm a changed man, Arthur.

NTV2_EXT_91 = ~z~I won't die over some nonsense spouted by a fool.

NTV2_EXT_92 = ~z~I ain't changed...

NTV2_EXT_93 = ~z~I'm still a bad man.

NTV2_EXT_94 = ~z~Maybe your path isn't changing, Arthur.

NTV2_EXT_95 = ~z~My path is coming to an end, Reverend.

NTV2_EXT_96 = ~z~I know, son...

NTV2_EXT_97 = ~z~I know...

NTV2_EXT_98 = ~z~and I know that you will face your destiny like a man...

NTV2_EXT_99 = ~z~like a warrior...

NTV2_EXT_100 = ~z~because that's what you are.

NTV2_EXT_101 = ~z~That's all I am...

NTV2_EXT_102 = ~z~a fighter...

NTV2_EXT_103 = ~z~a killer...

NTV2_EXT_104 = ~z~and a crazy man.

NTV2_EXT_105 = ~z~So be it.

NTV2_EXT_106 = ~z~You lived your way...

NTV2_EXT_107 = ~z~you'll die your way...

NTV2_EXT_108 = ~z~but in the time that you have left...

NTV2_EXT_109 = ~z~don't compromise...

NTV2_EXT_110 = ~z~and you'll do everything that you have to do, just fine.

NTV2_EXT_111 = ~z~We'll see.

NTV2_EXT_112 = ~z~I don't have to see, I know you.

NTV2_EXT_113 = ~z~Fight, and keep fighting.

NTV2_EXT_114 = ~z~Okay.

NTV2_EXT_115 = ~z~Good luck out there.

NTV2_EXT_116 = ~z~Be true to yourself, Mr. Morgan...

NTV2_EXT_117 = ~z~and leave the lies and the hypocrisy to fools like me.

NTV2_EXT_118 = ~z~Reverend?

NTV2_EXT_119 = ~z~Reverend...

NTV2_EXT_120 = ~z~what are you doing here?

NTV2_EXT_121 = ~z~I'm leaving.

NTV2_EXT_122 = ~z~Running away?

NTV2_EXT_123 = ~z~I suppose so, yes.

NTV2_EXT_124 = ~z~I'm running away.

NTV2_EXT_125 = ~z~I tried to make Dutch see sense but he's...

NTV2_EXT_126 = ~z~he's very strange, recently.

NTV2_EXT_127 = ~z~And the women? Little Jack?

NTV2_EXT_128 = ~z~You're leaving them?

NTV2_EXT_129 = ~z~I told them to run, too...

NTV2_EXT_130 = ~z~I asked them to come with me, but they wouldn't.

NTV2_EXT_131 = ~z~I'm changed...

NTV2_EXT_132 = ~z~I'm a changed man, Arthur.

NTV2_EXT_133 = ~z~I-I can't die for a bunch of nonsense spouted by a fool.

NTV2_EXT_134 = ~z~I understand.

NTV2_EXT_135 = ~z~You're...

NTV2_EXT_136 = ~z~well you're, you're not a good man, Arthur...

NTV2_EXT_137 = ~z~but you're not all bad...

NTV2_EXT_138 = ~z~either.

NTV2_EXT_139 = ~z~Everything will be...

NTV2_EXT_140 = ~z~your journey, your path, will be just fine.

NTV2_EXT_141 = ~z~I'm worried my path is coming to an end, Mr. Swanson.

NTV2_EXT_142 = ~z~Maybe.

NTV2_EXT_143 = ~z~I've felt that way for a long time about myself I mean, but...

NTV2_EXT_144 = ~z~but you'll do what's right.

NTV2_EXT_145 = ~z~I don't know about that.

NTV2_EXT_146 = ~z~I do.

NTV2_EXT_147 = ~z~Save who you can and let the rest rot...

NTV2_EXT_148 = ~z~and look after yourself.

NTV2_EXT_149 = ~z~Maybe.

NTV2_EXT_150 = ~z~We'll see.

NTV2_EXT_151 = ~z~You do see.

NTV2_EXT_152 = ~z~You just can't quite admit it to yourself.

NTV2_EXT_153 = ~z~All aboard!

NTV2_EXT_154 = ~z~Be well, Reverend.

NTV2_EXT_155 = ~z~All aboard!

NTV2_EXT_156 = ~z~You too, Arthur.

NTV2_EXT_157 = ~z~Sure.

NTV2_EXT_158 = ~z~Good luck out there.

NTV2_EXT_159 = ~z~You lived your life like a man, Arthur...

NTV2_EXT_160 = ~z~and you turned into a good man.

NTV2_EXT_161 = ~z~If we were all like you things might have turned out differently.

NTV2_EXT_162 = ~z~You're getting mighty sentimental, Reverend.

NTV2_EXT_LEADIN_1 = ~z~

NTV2_GRAPPLE_01 = ~z~Get off me!

NTV2_GRAPPLE_02 = ~z~You son of a bitch!

NTV2_GRAPPLE_03 = ~z~You won't get away with this!

NTV2_GRAPPLE_04 = ~z~I'll kill you!

NTV2_HOLDFIRE1_1 = ~z~Men, please, hold your fire!

NTV2_HOLDFIRE2_1 = ~z~Hold your fire!

NTV2_IG0_1 = ~t~In Lakota: These men are our friends... come on... let's go.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.5:3.2~Colonel Favours... Captain Monroe,~sl:0.1~we come in peace.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Hello again.~sl:1.6~Who are these two?

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_3 = ~z~They're, uh, friends of my people.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.8:0.0~Interesting looking fellows...

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_5 = ~z~Yeah, they won't cause any trouble.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_6 = ~z~Well, I should hope not.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_7 = ~z~

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_8 = ~z~Listen, Mr., uh...

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_9 = ~z~~sl:0.8:0.0~Chief.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3:1~Yes, uh, Mr... I can't... say that silly name.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_11 = ~z~~sl:0.3:2.5:1~In English they call me Rains Fall.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_12 = ~z~Yes, yes, I'm... I'm sure they do.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_13 = ~z~Listen... we're all Americans here... and, we... want an outcome,

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_14 = ~z~but quite frankly... quite frankly, I-I'm confused.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_15 = ~z~Your men are... little more than criminals, in my opinion.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_16 = ~z~Keep breaking peace treaties... we've made. Causing disturbances in everybody's lives.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_17 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.0~But... I pride myself on being a gentleman. Really, I do.~sl:1.0~But there are limits.

NTV2_IG1_CHAT_18 = ~z~So, let me be very...

NTV2_IG1_COUGHA_1 = ~z~

NTV2_IG1_COUGHB_1 = ~z~

NTV2_IG1_COUGHB_2 = ~z~

NTV2_IG2_1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.8~No, no. You know he's going to have Monroe... court martialled. Or, attempt to...~sl:1.1~he's going to make a disgrace of him.

NTV2_IG2_1_2 = ~z~Monroe? Seems likeable enough for a West Pointer, why?

NTV2_IG2_1_3 = ~z~You know what Favours is like... because he thinks it's right.

NTV2_IG2_1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Because he thinks Monroe is a patsy, or a spy.~sl:0.3~He's convinced he had something to do with those vaccines getting stolen...

NTV2_IG2_1_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.8~He thinks, Monroe is gonna force him into making a concession with the Indians.~sl:0.7~So he removes Monroe.

NTV2_IG2_1_6 = ~z~Removes how?

NTV2_IG2_1_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Favours wants him tried for treason...~sl:0.7~and hanged.

NTV2_IG2_1_8 = ~z~Why does... Favours care about the Indians?

NTV2_IG2_1_9 = ~z~Because he doesn't want to back down... his whole professional life...

NTV2_IG2_1_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~You know what they say about him.~sl:0.2~High-tail Favours. The man who missed a battle.

NTV2_IG2_1_11 = ~z~Poor Monroe... I kind of liked him.

NTV2_IG2_1_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~I know...~sl:0.9~well still, he's kinda stuck up.

NTV2_IG3_1 = ~z~~sl:1.3:4.0~I see that expecting you to understand my position,~sl:~as a representative of your government, is quite impossible.

NTV2_IG3_2 = ~z~I am my government... their government.

NTV2_IG3_3 = ~z~This... this was my land. These are my people.

NTV2_IG3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.6:2.3~That's not really the point here, sir.~sl:0.6~Get that through your skull.

NTV2_IG3_5 = ~z~Your men violated the treaty. That treaty is null, and void.

NTV2_IG3_6 = ~z~I have been appointed to negotiate a new treaty. That treaty will grant you new lands.

NTV2_IG4_1 = ~z~Feeling better?

NTV2_IG4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Yeah, come on.~sl:0.5:0.7:1~Let's go.

NTV2_INT_1 = ~z~I, um, I was, uh...

NTV2_INT_2 = ~z~Leaving again?

NTV2_INT_3 = ~z~Yes, just leaving...

NTV2_INT_4 = ~z~I'll see you soon.

NTV2_INT_5 = ~z~Perhaps.

NTV2_INT_6 = ~z~What do you mean?

NTV2_INT_7 = ~z~Well...

NTV2_INT_8 = ~z~if I was you, I'd disappear too.

NTV2_INT_9 = ~z~This is all pretty much over.

NTV2_INT_10 = ~z~Well, I'll be back.

NTV2_INT_11 = ~z~No you won't, let's not pretend no more.

NTV2_INT_12 = ~z~Get outta here.

NTV2_INT_13 = ~z~I'll miss you, Arthur.

NTV2_INT_14 = ~z~You've been a fine friend to me.

NTV2_INT_15 = ~z~No, let's not get over sentimental.

NTV2_INT_16 = ~z~Go on, place is quiet, get outta here...

NTV2_INT_17 = ~z~you go with my blessing.

NTV2_INT_18 = ~z~Thank you, Arthur.

NTV2_INT_19 = ~z~Found a friend looking for you.

NTV2_INT_20 = ~z~Mr. Morgan.

NTV2_INT_21 = ~z~Sir.

NTV2_INT_22 = ~z~How are you?

NTV2_INT_23 = ~z~A little better.

NTV2_INT_24 = ~z~I hope so.

NTV2_INT_25 = ~z~Found a friend looking for you.

NTV2_INT_26 = ~z~Mr. Morgan.

NTV2_INT_27 = ~z~Sir.

NTV2_INT_28 = ~z~How can I help you?

NTV2_INT_29 = ~z~I am sorry to impose on you again...

NTV2_INT_30 = ~z~but I believe I've made progress brokering peace.

NTV2_INT_31 = ~z~You have?

NTV2_INT_32 = ~z~I believe so.

NTV2_INT_33 = ~z~Colonel Favours has agreed to a meeting...

NTV2_INT_34 = ~z~to discuss, and maybe resolve...

NTV2_INT_35 = ~z~his alleged grievances and mine.

NTV2_INT_36 = ~z~Now, he has lied to me more times than I care to remember...

NTV2_INT_37 = ~z~but maybe this time...

NTV2_INT_38 = ~z~he must want peace.

NTV2_INT_39 = ~z~Why could he possibly want to humiliate us further?

NTV2_INT_40 = ~z~We got words for his kind, but they're colloquial.

NTV2_INT_41 = ~z~Perhaps I could make one last request...

NTV2_INT_42 = ~z~my men are not allowed to carry arms.

NTV2_INT_43 = ~z~You want us to keep the peace?

NTV2_INT_44 = ~z~Yeah, it'll be a lot of dull talking and ceremony...

NTV2_INT_45 = ~z~but I feel with some non-tribe members present...

NTV2_INT_46 = ~z~their chances of lying or worse will be reduced.

NTV2_INT_47 = ~z~Will you, Arthur?

NTV2_INT_48 = ~z~It ain't my business, brother.

NTV2_INT_49 = ~z~No, I know.

NTV2_INT_50 = ~z~But it is mine.

NTV2_INT_51 = ~z~Do it for me?

NTV2_INT_52 = ~z~Charles, I got...

NTV2_INT_53 = ~z~I've saved your life.

NTV2_INT_54 = ~z~Do it for me.

NTV2_INT_55 = ~z~Sure...

NTV2_INT_56 = ~z~come on.

NTV2_INT_57 = ~z~You owe this man.

NTV2_INT_58 = ~z~You should have him do your negotiations.

NTV2_INT_59 = ~z~Let's go.

NTV2_INT_LI_1 = ~z~Josiah.

NTV2_MBANT_H_1 = ~z~We'll do what we can.

NTV2_MBANT_L_1 = ~z~You can't worry about that now.

NTV2_MCOVER_01 = ~z~This is insanity!

NTV2_MCOVER_02 = ~z~This was meant to be a truce!

NTV2_MCOVER_03 = ~z~We're sitting ducks here!

NTV2_MCOVER_04 = ~z~How did this go so wrong?

NTV2_MCOVER_05 = ~z~Favours wanted this to happen.

NTV2_MCOVER_06 = ~z~They're trying to surround us.

NTV2_MCOVER_07 = ~z~I knew this was a mistake.

NTV2_MCOVER_08 = ~z~I am sorry, Mr. Morgan, I cannot kill these men!

NTV2_MCS1_1 = ~z~You okay, man?

NTV2_MCS1_2 = ~z~Someone...

NTV2_MCS1_3 = ~z~Jackson, take him away.

NTV2_MCS1_4 = ~z~Where was I?

NTV2_MCS1_5 = ~z~You're a gentleman with limits?

NTV2_MCS1_6 = ~z~Are you being facetious, sir?

NTV2_MCS1_7 = ~z~Come this way, buddy.

NTV2_MCS1_8 = ~z~I said, “are you being facetious”, Captain Monroe?

NTV2_MCS1_9 = ~z~No, sir, I am not.

NTV2_MCS1_10 = ~z~Chief Rains...

NTV2_MCS1_11 = ~z~That's, uh...

NTV2_MCS1_12 = ~z~Rains Fall.

NTV2_MCS1_13 = ~z~Exactly.

NTV2_MCS1_14 = ~z~Chief Rains, the thing is...

NTV2_MCS1_15 = ~z~It's quite a cough.

NTV2_MCS1_16 = ~z~Sure.

NTV2_MCS1_17 = ~z~Wait here...

NTV2_MCS1_18 = ~z~I'll fetch you some water.

NTV2_MCS1_19 = ~z~I-I'll be fine.

NTV2_MCS1_20 = ~z~Thank you.

NTV2_MCS3_1 = ~z~The lands you currently occupy...

NTV2_MCS3_2 = ~z~belong to the United States Government.

NTV2_MCS3_3 = ~z~Why is this so confusing, sir?

NTV2_MCS3_4 = ~z~Why?

NTV2_MCS3_5 = ~z~Good day, Colonel Favours.

NTV2_MCS3_6 = ~z~Well, that was remarkably unproductive...

NTV2_MCS3_7 = ~z~Charles...

NTV2_MCS3_8 = ~z~I'm afraid the Federal Government was quite clear, Colonel...

NTV2_MCS3_9 = ~z~that it wanted peace, and peace for all...

NTV2_MCS3_10 = ~z~and that the treaty had not been broken by anybody.

NTV2_MCS3_11 = ~z~Oh, is that so, sir?

NTV2_MCS3_12 = ~z~And did it want impudence, sir...

NTV2_MCS3_13 = ~z~from a junior officer in public?

NTV2_MCS3_14 = ~z~Was that it's plan too, sir?

NTV2_MCS3_15 = ~z~You insult me...

NTV2_MCS3_16 = ~z~you insult the regiment.

NTV2_MCS3_17 = ~z~Arrest this man.

NTV2_MCS3_18 = ~z~Arrest me?

NTV2_MCS3_19 = ~z~Gross insubordination.

NTV2_MCS3_20 = ~z~Disobeying an order.

NTV2_MCS3_21 = ~z~Treason.

NTV2_MCS3_22 = ~z~Are you mad?

NTV2_MCS3_23 = ~z~You had those vaccines stolen...

NTV2_MCS3_24 = ~z~you disrupted a negotiation...

NTV2_MCS3_25 = ~z~Let him go.

NTV2_MCS3_26 = ~z~This is all getting out of hand.

NTV2_MCS3_27 = ~z~I...

NTV2_MCS3_28 = ~z~Captain Monroe, let's get out of here.

NTV2_MCS3_29 = ~z~I, uh...

NTV2_MCS3_30 = ~z~If I were you I'd keep my mouth shut, amigo...
