SPSNW_IG1_JOHN_3 = ~z~Me too... me too!

SPSNW_IG1_JOHN_4 = ~z~What you wandering for?

SPSNW_IG1_JOHN_5 = ~z~No idea...

SPSNW_IG1_JOHN_6 = ~z~Me too... me too!

SPSNW_IG1_JOHN_7 = ~z~I'll... yeah I'll see you around, enjoy the sun! It's the one true God, you know.

SPSNW_IG1_JOHN_8 = ~z~Helios... nothing else matters, all else is lies!

SPSNW_IG2_JOHN_1 = ~z~Oh... how you doing? Isn't it marvelous... isn't it amazing, simply wonderful, no god awful clouds!

SPSNW_IG2_JOHN_2 = ~z~Uh... it's a bit hot for me.

SPSNW_IG2_JOHN_3 = ~z~Nonsense! We were made for this heat, made for it. Beautiful...

SPSNW_IG2_JOHN_4 = ~z~

SPSNW_IG3_1 = ~z~You know, America has always needed myths. America needs stories.

SPSNW_IG3_2 = ~z~Bunch of land of people who didn't like Europe too much... quick, write a story!

SPSNW_IG3_3 = ~z~I don't need myths. I don't need a story. I have the sun... the sun is my story.

SPSNW_IG4_JOHN_3 = ~z~Me neither, me neither... so I gave up looking.

SPSNW_IG4_JOHN_4 = ~z~But, then I realized... it doesn't matter so very much!

SPSNW_IG4_JOHN_5 = ~z~I have all I need here. Up there!

SPSNW_IG4_JOHN_6 = ~z~That is all we need. The rest is man turned insane!

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_1 = ~z~You know what I blame, sir?

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_2 = ~z~Blame for what?

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_3 = ~z~For mankind's folly, of course.

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_4 = ~z~No idea...

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_5 = ~z~Have a guess.

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_6 = ~z~Err... greed? Stupidity?

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_7 = ~z~Artificial light. It's a curse!

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_8 = ~z~This... she... she is our light. Live by her!

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_9 = ~z~The fake stuff, well... well, every stupid thing we have done has been done under artificial light.

SPSNW_IG5_JOHN_10 = ~z~I blame Prometheus, I really do!

SPSNW_IG7_JOHN_2 = ~z~How do you even survive out here? What do you eat? Drink?

SPSNW_IG7_JOHN_3 = ~z~Eat? Drink?

SPSNW_IG7_JOHN_4 = ~z~I've got the sun, the sun is my nourishment, it's everything... at least for those of us who see properly.

SPSNW_IG7_JOHN_5 = ~z~Well, I must be blind then.

SPSNW_IG7_JOHN_6 = ~z~Very sorry to hear that.

SPSNW_IG7_JOHN_7 = ~z~Yeah.

SPSNW_IG8_HELLO_1 = ~z~Oh, hello... It's you again.

SPSNW_IG8_HELLO_2 = ~z~You enjoying the weather?

SPSNW_IG8_JOHN_1 = ~z~It's pretty brutal.

SPSNW_IG8_JOHN_2 = ~z~Brutal? This is perfect. Hot sun and smiles...

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_1 = ~z~Now, I hope this time, you're gonna keep your temper, sir.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_2 = ~z~The beautiful weather can do strange things to a man.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_3 = ~z~Don't be fractious.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_4 = ~z~Let the sun warm your bones and warm your soul. Be happy.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_5 = ~z~What are you, a goddamn lizard?

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_6 = ~z~Relax my friend. This is healthy, nutritious, life giving.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_7 = ~z~That... that orb... that glowing orb, that orb is our real god, and we should worship it as such.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_8 = ~z~Seems kind of an angry god to me.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_9 = ~z~You're fighting a war you cannot win. Embrace the sun.

SPSNW_IG9_JOHN_10 = ~z~

SPSNW_IG10_P1_1 = ~z~Listen, my friend... please don't try to kill me again... it's a little annoying.

SPSNW_IG10_P1_2 = ~z~I'm not causing you any trouble.

SPSNW_IG10_P1_3 = ~z~I mean, isn't this desert big enough for both of us to enjoy it in peace?

SPSNW_IG10_P2_1 = ~z~Oh, no... you're too tough to leave people like me alone.

SPSNW_IG10_P2_2 = ~z~Well, I've had enough. I'm not talking to you anymore!

SPSNW_IG11_1_1 = ~z~Yoo hoo! Be well there down there... enjoy the weather!

SPSNW_IG11_2_1 = ~z~Helios is bestowing his munificence upon us once again!

SPSNW_IG11_2_2 = ~z~Fantastic, isn't it? Be well, sir!

SPSNW_IG11_3_1 = ~z~My god is shining in the heavens... life is heat and my god bestows heat and goodness.

SPSNW_IG11_3_2 = ~z~Thank you, thank you, thank you!

SPSNW_IG11_3_3 = ~z~This is a beautiful universe we have been given.

SPSNW_IG11_3_4 = ~z~Thank you... thank you, thank you!

SPSNW_IG11_4_1 = ~z~Life is heat sir... life is heat... never forget that! Life is heat...

SPSNW_IG13_1_1 = ~z~Well, if you wouldn't mind leaving me to enjoy this in peace.

SPSNW_IG13_2_1 = ~z~Now, please... if you could leave Helios and I to our wonderful symbiosis...

SPSNW_IG13_3_1 = ~z~Now, I must be alone to appreciate this in all its glory...

SPSNW_IG13_4_1 = ~z~Go, my friend. Find your own path to light and peace.
