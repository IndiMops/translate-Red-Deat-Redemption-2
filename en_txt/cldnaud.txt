C2_CLERKIDLE_01 = ~z~They made me do it, I swear.

C2_CLERKIDLE_02 = ~z~Don't tell the police, please.

C2_CLERKIDLE_03 = ~z~I'm really not a bad man.

C2_CLERKIDLE_04 = ~z~This is my brother's store. I'm just watching it while he's away.

C2_CLERKREACT_1 = ~z~What's back here? It looks like this pulls out or something?

C2_CLERKREACT_2 = ~z~Pulls out? No, it's just an old bookcase, seen better days.

C2_CLERKSCRATCH_1 = ~z~This don't seem right...

C2_CLERKSCRATCH_2 = ~z~Sir? What are you doing back there?

C2_CLERKWARN_1 = ~z~Oh, er, nothing much back there, I'm afraid... just a few old books.

C2_CLERKWELCOME_1 = ~z~Hi there, mister. Feel free to browse.

C2_CLERKWELCOME_2 = ~z~Shall do.

C2_CLOSING_1 = ~z~Well, you just let me know if I can help at all.

C2_DAWD_02 = ~z~Senor?

C2_DAWD_03 = ~t~In Spanish: Where are you taking us?

C2_GENERAL_01 = ~z~Looking for anything in particular?

C2_GENERAL_02 = ~z~Got a few paintings over there, something for the wife maybe?

C2_GENERAL_03 = ~z~You timed it well. Some quality pieces in at the moment.

C2_HOLDUP1_1 = ~z~Where are they?

C2_HOLDUP1_2 = ~z~Who?

C2_HOLDUP1_3 = ~z~The people you're hiding! I know they're here, don't lie to me!

C2_HOLDUP1_5 = ~z~Where are they?

C2_HOLDUP1_6 = ~z~There's a door behind the bookcase there.

C2_STAYDOWN_1 = ~z~Son of a bitch.

C2_STRANGE_1 = ~z~I must say, you're acting very strange.

RCLDN_GRIEF_PRE_03 = ~z~Hey now, just calm down!

RCLDN_ILODAWDLE_01 = ~z~Can you help, sir?

RCLDN_ILODAWDLE_02 = ~z~Can you spare a little?

RCLDN_ILODAWDLE_03 = ~z~Well, sir?

RCLDN_RC1_ILO_1 = ~z~I ain't so kind.

RCLDN_RC1_ILO_2 = ~z~Yes you are, sir.

RCLDN_RC1_ILO_3 = ~z~You have it in you, I can tell.

RCLDN_RC1_ILO_4 = ~z~I'm a nasty bit of work, father.

RCLDN_RSC1_1 = ~z~I ain't so kind.

RCLDN_RSC1_2 = ~z~Yes you are, sir. You have it in you I can tell.

RCLDN_RSC1_3 = ~z~I'm a nasty bit of work, Father.

RCLDN_RSC1_4 = ~z~You're wrong on two counts, sir.

RCLDN_RSC1_5 = ~z~I'm a humble Brother.

RCLDN_RSC1_6 = ~z~A penitent monk, not a priest...

RCLDN_RSC1_7 = ~z~and you're a magnificent bit of work.

RCLDN_RSC1_8 = ~z~You may have made some...

RCLDN_RSC1_9 = ~z~some poor choices...

RCLDN_RSC1_10 = ~z~but which of us hasn't?

RCLDN_RSC1_11 = ~z~You have no idea.

RCLDN_RSC1_12 = ~z~But you do...

RCLDN_RSC1_13 = ~z~and God does, and that's enough for me...

RCLDN_RSC1_14 = ~z~and for him.

RCLDN_RSC1_15 = ~z~We shall see.

RCLDN_RSC1_16 = ~z~That we shall, sir...

RCLDN_RSC1_17 = ~z~but why don't you hedge your bets...

RCLDN_RSC1_18 = ~z~and give two bits to the poor?

RCLDN_RSC1_19 = ~z~There are so many who will go hungry tonight.

RCLDN_RSC1_20 = ~z~A little can go such a long way.

RCLDN_RSC1_21 = ~z~Every coin makes a difference in someone's life.

RCLDN_RSC1_22 = ~z~I can see you're persuaded.

RCLDN_RSC1_23 = ~z~I'm sorry.

RCLDN_RSC1_24 = ~z~I've pressured you enough.

RCLDN_RSC1_25 = ~z~I'm afraid I...

RCLDN_RSC1_26 = ~z~I can't save the poor.

RCLDN_RSC1_27 = ~z~Fair enough.

RCLDN_RSC1_28 = ~z~You see, I've been poor...

RCLDN_RSC1_29 = ~z~and charity...

RCLDN_RSC1_30 = ~z~it never did anyone any good.

RCLDN_RSC1_31 = ~z~I'm sure. What do I know?

RCLDN_RSC1_32 = ~z~I'm just a fool making foolish choices myself.

RCLDN_RSC1_33 = ~z~Sure.

RCLDN_RSC1_34 = ~z~Bless you, sir.

RCLDN_RSC1_35 = ~z~How you getting on, anyhow?

RCLDN_RSC1_36 = ~z~These are a somewhat apathetic lot I'm afraid.

RCLDN_RSC1_37 = ~z~My, umm...

RCLDN_RSC1_38 = ~z~my mentor says that America...

RCLDN_RSC1_39 = ~z~is designed to induce apathy in people.

RCLDN_RSC1_40 = ~z~That's a wonderful insight.

RCLDN_RSC1_41 = ~z~He must be a wise man, your mentor.

RCLDN_RSC1_42 = ~z~Well sometimes he's a downright fool but...

RCLDN_RSC1_43 = ~z~well...

RCLDN_RSC1_44 = ~z~usually, he's the best man I know.

RCLDN_RSC1_45 = ~z~That's wonderful.

RCLDN_RSC1_46 = ~z~The, the thing is I'm...

RCLDN_RSC1_47 = ~z~well, poverty will always be with us...

RCLDN_RSC1_48 = ~z~but slavery, I-I thought we had banished that.

RCLDN_RSC1_49 = ~z~But Saint Denis is acting as a staging post...

RCLDN_RSC1_50 = ~z~for shipping slaves out to some of the islands.

RCLDN_RSC1_51 = ~z~I don't believe you, it's 1899.

RCLDN_RSC1_52 = ~z~Maybe you should have a look yourself.

RCLDN_RSC1_53 = ~z~I've heard that the pawnbroker down the block...

RCLDN_RSC1_54 = ~z~around the corner...

RCLDN_RSC1_55 = ~z~the one with the green door...

RCLDN_RSC1_56 = ~z~well they say he sells more than forlorn trinkets.

RCLDN_RSC1_57 = ~z~Help the poor.

RCLDN_RSC2_I1_1 = ~z~How about you open that door?

RCLDN_RSC2_I1_2 = ~z~Door? What door?

RCLDN_RSC2_I2_1 = ~z~The hidden door.

RCLDN_RSC2_I2_2 = ~z~Or I'll open the hidden door in your chest!

RCLDN_RSC2_I2_3 = ~z~They made me do it. I was always good to them, but they-they forced me to do it sir... I... swear.

RCLDN_RSC2_I3_1 = ~z~Open the door, now!

RCLDN_RSC2_I3_2 = ~z~Okay, okay! Just pull the big red book on the bookshelf.

RCLDN_RSC2_I3_3 = ~z~It's called "The Scourge of Crossbreeding" by Harold MacDougal!

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1A_1 = ~z~A bit of a strange question, but you heard tell of slavers 'round here, buddy?

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1A_2 = ~z~What?

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_1 = ~z~How about you open the door?

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_2 = ~z~Door? What door?

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_3 = ~z~The hidden door.

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_4 = ~z~Or I'll open the hidden door in your chest!

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_5 = ~z~They made me do it, sir. I always treat them good, but I was forced to do it, sir, I...

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_6 = ~z~Open the door, now!

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1C_7 = ~z~P-p-p-p-pull the big red book. It's called "The Scourge of Crossbreeding" by Harold MacDougal...

RCLDN_RSC2_IG1D_1 = ~z~Something don't seem right...

RCLDN_RSC2_IG3A_1 = ~z~~sl:2.1:0.0~Now don't worry, I'm on your side.

RCLDN_RSC2_IG3A_2 = ~z~

RCLDN_RSC2_IG3B_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8:1~Please, I'm on your side. It's going to be okay.

RCLDN_RSC2_IG4_1 = ~z~Here. Take that, and come with me. I know someone who can help you.

RCLDN_RSC3_1 = ~z~Brother...

RCLDN_RSC3_2 = ~z~Brother Dorkins, friend.

RCLDN_RSC3_3 = ~z~Arthur...

RCLDN_RSC3_4 = ~z~Arthur Morgan.

RCLDN_RSC3_5 = ~z~Come on.

RCLDN_RSC3_6 = ~z~You were right...

RCLDN_RSC3_7 = ~z~I found these two imprisoned in that shop.

RCLDN_RSC3_8 = ~z~Oh, my...

RCLDN_RSC3_9 = ~z~that's...

RCLDN_RSC3_10 = ~z~well, they are blessed to have met you, Arthur.

RCLDN_RSC3_11 = ~z~Trust me, in that they're very unusual...

RCLDN_RSC3_12 = ~z~I don't think they speak much English.

RCLDN_RSC3_13 = ~z~My brothers, come.

RCLDN_RSC3_14 = ~z~Let's go get something to eat.

RCLDN_RSC3_15 = ~t~In French: Eat...

RCLDN_RSC3_16 = ~t~In Spanish: Food...

RCLDN_RSC3_17 = ~z~Please.

RCLDN_RSC3_18 = ~z~Hey, you forgot this.

RCLDN_RSC3_19 = ~z~Oh, yes.

RCLDN_RSC3_20 = ~z~Thank you, I...

RCLDN_RSC3_21 = ~z~here.

RCLDN_RSC3_22 = ~z~Payment...

RCLDN_RSC3_23 = ~z~for your services.

RCLDN_RSC3_24 = ~z~I could not have freed these men myself.

RCLDN_RSC3_25 = ~z~Thank you, Brother.

RCLDN_RSC3_26 = ~z~It's very kind of you.

RCLDN_RSC3_27 = ~z~Be well, sir.

RCLDN_RSC3_28 = ~z~Come see me again sometime.

RCLDN_RSC3_29 = ~z~I often work at the old church...

RCLDN_RSC3_30 = ~z~on Gaspar Street in St. Frances.

RCLDN_RSC3_31 = ~z~Give it to the poor, Brother.

RCLDN_RSC3_32 = ~z~Thank you, I will.

RCLDN_RSC3_33 = ~z~Like I said, magnificent.

RCLDN_RSC3_34 = ~z~Come on. Come, come, come.

RCLDN_RSC3_35 = ~z~Come see me again sometime.

RCLDN_RSC3_36 = ~z~I often work at the old church...

RCLDN_RSC3_37 = ~z~on Gaspar Street in St. Frances.

RCLDN_RSC3_LI_1 = ~z~Brother?

RCLDN_RSC3_LI_2 = ~z~Brother Dorkins, friend.

RCLDN_RSC3_LI_3 = ~z~Arthur. Arthur Morgan.

RCLDN_RSC3_LI_4 = ~z~Come on.

RCLDN_RSC4_1 = ~z~Sir.

RCLDN_RSC4_2 = ~z~Brother Dorkins told me about the wonderful thing you did.

RCLDN_RSC4_3 = ~z~He talks a lot of nonsense...

RCLDN_RSC4_4 = ~z~no offense.

RCLDN_RSC4_5 = ~z~None taken.

RCLDN_RSC4_6 = ~z~None taken at all.

RCLDN_RSC4_7 = ~z~Hey, stop!

RCLDN_RSC4_8 = ~z~These kids, they're the worst.

RCLDN_RSC4_9 = ~z~Don't hurt him, please!

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_1 = ~z~I hate this, it's too hard!

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_2 = ~z~Take your time.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_3 = ~z~"I lick... I-I lick?"

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_4 = ~z~Like.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_5 = ~z~"I like the soon... sooner..."

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_6 = ~z~Goddammit what does this even mean?

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_7 = ~z~Watch your language, please. "Summer." "Summer." "I like the summer."

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_8 = ~z~Don't worry. You know the letters, you know the sounds, you're nearly there!

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_9 = ~z~I got no use for stupid books.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_10 = ~z~"I don't have any use for stupid books."

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_11 = ~z~If you ain't, why you making us do it?

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_12 = ~z~No, you should say, "I don't have any," not "I got no".

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_13 = ~z~I think you may be confusing things a little now, Brother Dorkins.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG1_14 = ~z~Go over it first in your head. Take your time.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2A_1 = ~z~Are you ready to try out loud again?

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2B_1 = ~z~The rest of you don't snigger. You're next.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2C_1 = ~z~Don't worry, you're doing very well.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2D_1 = ~z~I know it's difficult now, but it'll all be worth it, I promise.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2E_1 = ~z~Just relax...

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2F_1 = ~z~Read on a little. Make the sounds first in your head.

RCLDN_RSC4_IG2G_1 = ~z~There's no rush...

RCLDN_RSC4_IG3A_1 = ~z~Oh no, my mother gave me that when I was a girl...

RCLDN_RSC4_IG3B_1 = ~z~Would you try and get it back for me, please?

RCLDN_RSC4_IG3C_1 = ~z~If he gets away I'll never see it again!

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_A_1 = ~z~Try again, please... read.

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_A_2 = ~z~It is m... w... m...

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_A_3 = ~z~Por favor... it's warm, W, an upside down M.

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_A_4 = ~z~I don't get it.

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_A_5 = ~z~Oh, you will. It's like swimming, it takes time, but then it is easy...

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_A_6 = ~z~and the whole world opens to you.

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_B_1 = ~z~Sister, my friend, Mr. Morgan.

RCLDN_RSC4_LI_B_2 = ~z~Oh...

RCLDN_RSC6_1 = ~z~Mr. Morgan.

RCLDN_RSC6_2 = ~z~Excuse me, Father...

RCLDN_RSC6_3 = ~z~Sister...

RCLDN_RSC6_4 = ~z~I got your cross.

RCLDN_RSC6_5 = ~z~You didn't!

RCLDN_RSC6_6 = ~z~No, I did.

RCLDN_RSC6_7 = ~z~I hope the boy...

RCLDN_RSC6_8 = ~z~He's fine...

RCLDN_RSC6_9 = ~z~physically...

RCLDN_RSC6_10 = ~z~mentally he's a piece of work but...

RCLDN_RSC6_11 = ~z~who am I to say...

RCLDN_RSC6_12 = ~z~Brother Dorkins was right about you...

RCLDN_RSC6_13 = ~z~you are the most wonderful man.

RCLDN_RSC6_14 = ~z~Brother Dorkins is...

RCLDN_RSC6_15 = ~z~greatly deceived I'm afraid, but...

RCLDN_RSC6_16 = ~z~I'm happy to help a little.

RCLDN_RSC6_17 = ~z~Thank you...

RCLDN_RSC6_18 = ~z~you see it's a thing, but...

RCLDN_RSC6_19 = ~z~my mother gave it to me when I was a novice...

RCLDN_RSC6_20 = ~z~shortly before she passed.

RCLDN_RSC6_21 = ~z~You are the most wonderful man.

RCLDN_RSC6_22 = ~z~Excuse me, Father...

RCLDN_RSC6_23 = ~z~Sister...

RCLDN_RSC6_24 = ~z~enjoy your day.

RCLDN_RSC6_25 = ~z~See, Father...

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_1 = ~z~Every day, it's a new challenge, Father.

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_2 = ~z~When I was younger, those challenges used to frustrate me,

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_3 = ~z~but then over time I learned to ask "how" instead of "why."

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_4 = ~z~Often, the people that are most in need of our help, are the most resistant to it.

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_5 = ~z~But that's not a reason to give up on them, n-n-no. Much the opposite.

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_6 = ~z~If we seek gratitude and recognition...

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_7 = ~z~that allows... will, and our own needs, to take the place of sacrifice...

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_8 = ~z~And after all, isn't that the problem of most charities today?

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_9 = ~z~It's more about the giver feeling better about himself, than the good of the receiver.

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_10 = ~z~Perhaps... but then should they not give at all?

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_11 = ~z~None of us are perfect, or, purely driven by good.

RCLDN_RSC6_IG1_12 = ~z~Not even you, Sister Calderon.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_A_1 = ~z~And how is Brother Dorkins, by the way? I worry about that one.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_A_2 = ~z~I feel, Father, Brother Dorkins is a simple soul,

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_A_3 = ~z~and sometimes a little abrupt in his methods.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_A_4 = ~z~But what a soul! What fire! What truth burns in him.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_A_5 = ~z~He's... he's the one I want alongside when darkness comes.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0:1~Mr. Morgan!

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_2 = ~z~Excuse me, Father...

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_3 = ~z~Sister,

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_4 = ~z~I got your cross.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_5 = ~z~~sl:0.6:1.1:1~You didn't!

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0:1~No, I did.

RCLDN_RSC6_LI_B_7 = ~z~~sl:0.7:1.1:1~I hope the boy...

RCLDN_RSC6_LO_1 = ~z~Brother Dorkins found him...

RCLDN_RSC6_LO_2 = ~z~I told you...

RCLDN_RSC6_LO_3 = ~z~Brother Dorkins was fantastic.

RCLDN_RSC_5_1 = ~z~Hey...

RCLDN_RSC_5_2 = ~z~you want some company, mister?

RCLDN_RSC_5_3 = ~z~No.

RCLDN_RSC_5_4 = ~z~You sure?

RCLDN_RSC_5_5 = ~z~Hey...

RCLDN_RSC_5_6 = ~z~What?

RCLDN_RSC_5_7 = ~z~I know you.

RCLDN_RSC_5_8 = ~z~Mrs. Downes?

RCLDN_RSC_5_9 = ~z~Oh, no. Not you.

RCLDN_RSC_5_10 = ~z~Get away.

RCLDN_RSC_5_11 = ~z~How, I mean...~n~~m~ Now.

RCLDN_RSC_5_12 = ~z~Hey...~n~~m~Help.

RCLDN_RSC_5_13 = ~z~Help.

RCLDN_RSC_5_14 = ~z~Hold on...

RCLDN_RSC_5_15 = ~z~This man is bothering me.

RCLDN_RSC_5_16 = ~z~Now...

RCLDN_RSC_5_17 = ~z~Someone help me.

RCLDN_RSC_5_18 = ~z~Officer, help!

RCLDN_S2MEET_1 = ~z~Come see me again some time. I often work at the old church on Gaspar Street in St. Frances.

RCLDN_S2_IG4_AR_1 = ~z~You alright?

RCLDN_S2_IG4_AR_2 = ~z~Oh, I'll live.

RCLDN_S2_IG4_AR_3 = ~z~A kid did this?
