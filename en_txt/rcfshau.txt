RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_2 = ~z~Let me guess, to Jeremy Gill.

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_3 = ~z~How did you know?

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_4 = ~z~There's a bunch of you fellers, feller gets sent a lot of fish...

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_5 = ~z~That so?

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_6 = ~z~Sure.

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_7 = ~z~He says he's really famous.

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_8 = ~z~I wouldn't know about that, good luck.

RCFSH_IG1_ARTHR_10 = ~z~

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_1 = ~z~Like I said, fame hasn't changed me.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_2 = ~z~But it has opened a lot of doors that were previously closed.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_3 = ~z~I'm actually planning on turning fishing into a way of, well, uniting nations.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_4 = ~z~I'm gonna head to DC, discuss it with the president.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_5 = ~z~Then I'm gonna head over to Europe... bring the royal families together, while I teach them how to fish.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_6 = ~z~Hurry up... let's catch this fish and go home.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_7 = ~z~Oh, I'm ready.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_8 = ~z~And now we wait... that's the thing about fish... they can sense when you're desperate.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_9 = ~z~Sure.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_10 = ~z~Yeah... so we gotta stay calm, just... relax...

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_11 = ~z~Hurray.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_12 = ~z~You know, I write poems. Would you like to hear...

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_13 = ~z~No, thank you.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_14 = ~z~Okay.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_15 = ~z~I got invited to China. I'm gonna fish with the emperor there.

RCFSH_IG2_CV1_J_16 = ~z~Where's this goddamn catfish?

RCFSH_IG2_CV2_J_1 = ~z~So then I said, listen sister...

RCFSH_IG2_CV2_J_2 = ~z~I don't care if you're The Queen of Sheba, not just of England... fishing is an art form...

RCFSH_IG2_CV2_J_3 = ~z~Yeah and she kept quiet after that... until dinner...

RCFSH_IG2_CV2_J_4 = ~z~

RCFSH_IG2_CV2_J_5 = ~z~Hey, chum! Wake up, the fish can tell if you're sleeping.

RCFSH_IG2_CV2_J_6 = ~z~Yeah, sorry... where is that damn fish?

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_1 = ~z~I was out there for five days wrestling that monster... but I got 'em in the end!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_2 = ~z~You know, the villagers were so grateful, the chief gave me his daughter....

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_3 = ~z~Hey, chum!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_4 = ~z~Sorry.

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_5 = ~z~Oh, oh, oh. I think we got something...

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_6 = ~z~Oh, we got something!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_7 = ~z~Is it that catfish?

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_8 = ~z~It's something big!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_9 = ~z~Good, hurry up.

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_10 = ~z~Don't you rush me, chum...

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_11 = ~z~This is me and the gods wrestling for immortality... oh my God! It's a monster!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_12 = ~z~Oh God, he's gone again.

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_13 = ~z~Damn!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_14 = ~z~Oh, oh, no! I still got him on the line...

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_15 = ~z~You get ready!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_16 = ~z~He's gonna come back again, I'm gonna pull him in just a little bit...

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_17 = ~z~And I'm gonna tire him out... get the camera ready!

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_18 = ~z~I'm ready.

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_19 = ~z~Oh, come on, boy! Come on, boy.

RCFSH_IG2_CV3_J_20 = ~z~Oh, come on, he's huge! Come on! Here... get this, get this!

RCFSH_LEFT_1 = ~z~Alright, let's cut left here down to the river.

RCFSH_MOUNTUP_01 = ~z~Mount up, we have quite a ride ahead of us.

RCFSH_MOUNTUP_02 = ~z~Come along then.

RCFSH_MOUNTUP_03 = ~z~I hope you move faster than this with that camera.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_3 = ~z~Turned a horrible pallid yellow color and weighs close to two hundred pounds, by all accounts.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_4 = ~z~What?

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_6 = ~z~Old Chalky,~rp~ El Diablo Amarillo... oh I'll come up with something, I always do.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_7 = ~z~I already have a draft of this written for my newspaper column.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_8 = ~z~You haven't caught it yet.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_9 = ~z~Yes, but never has a conclusion been more foregone.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_10 = ~z~So~rp~ what exactly am I getting out of this again?

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_11 = ~z~What are you getting out of it?~rp~ Only the best day of your mundane little existence.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_12 = ~z~How often do you get to be part of a legend?~rp~ To experience a masterclass in extreme angling up close and personal?

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_13 = ~z~To watch an artist paint his masterpiece.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_14 = ~z~I was talking about money.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_15 = ~z~Good God. The avarice.

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_16 = ~z~Do you think Hannibal was haggling as he went over the Alps?

RCFSH_RBANTP1J_17 = ~z~You'll be handsomely rewarded, don't you worry about that.

RCFSH_RBANTP2J_1 = ~z~A Japanese man once offered me five hundred dollars just for an hour of my company.

RCFSH_RBANTP2J_2 = ~z~I told him “add a zero and maybe then we can talk, chum!”.

RCFSH_RSC1_1 = ~z~Hello, chum.

RCFSH_RSC1_2 = ~z~Chum?

RCFSH_RSC1_3 = ~z~Do you want an autograph?

RCFSH_RSC1_4 = ~z~Or a photograph?

RCFSH_RSC1_5 = ~z~I'm sorry?

RCFSH_RSC1_46 = ~z~like actual friends.

RCFSH_RSC1_47 = ~z~No, I'm fine, it's...

RCFSH_RSC1_48 = ~z~sort of ridiculous.

RCFSH_RSC1_49 = ~z~Listen, chum...

RCFSH_RSC1_50 = ~z~people love it...

RCFSH_RSC1_51 = ~z~and I could sell even more fish, if I had them.
