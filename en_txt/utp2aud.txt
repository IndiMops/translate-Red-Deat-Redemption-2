UTP2_BANT01_6 = ~z~I mean... how many men? Guns? Riders?

UTP2_BANT01_7 = ~z~Nothing serious. ~rp~It'll be fine.

UTP2_BANT01_9 = ~z~You worry too much.

UTP2_BANT01_10 = ~z~Forgive me if I ain't wholly faithful in something an O'Driscoll told you,

UTP2_BANT01_11 = ~z~when you was half-drunk in a jail cell.

UTP2_BANT01_12 = ~z~He kept yapping about it, ~rp~saying how they been hitting it on the regular.

UTP2_BANT01_13 = ~z~That's a good lead in my book.

UTP2_BANT04_6 = ~z~Dutch can't say we ain't pulling our weight no more, can he?

UTP2_BANT04_7 = ~z~I ain't sure I trust this new act of yours one bit.
