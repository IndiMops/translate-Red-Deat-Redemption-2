PHMRB_REACTGUN1_01 = ~z~What are you shooting at?

PHMRB_REACTGUN1_02 = ~z~I can't even see what you're aiming at.

PHMRB_REACTGUN1_03 = ~z~You seem to be shooting at thin air, but what do I know?

PHRM7_SEARCH_A_1 = ~z~I don't see anything.

PHRM7_SEARCH_A_2 = ~z~Shh, just keep your eyes peeled.

PHRM7_SEARCH_J_1 = ~z~I don't see anything.

PHRM7_SEARCH_J_2 = ~z~Shh, just keep your eyes peeled.

PRHM7AILO_PBA1_1 = ~z~Charlotte, it was a pleasure meeting you.

PRHM7AILO_PBA1_2 = ~z~You too, Arthur. Please be well.

PRHM7JILO_PBA1_1 = ~z~You take care of yourself out here, ma'am.

PRHM7_AFSHOT_1_1 = ~z~Hey, what are you doing over there? Did you see my shot?

PRHM7_AFSHOT_2_1 = ~z~Come here, you silly man. I want to thank you.

PRHM7_AFSHOT_3_1 = ~z~Well, I'll be here once you're done with whatever it is you're doing.

PRHM7_AHOWSKN1_1 = ~z~Yes, this is a good spot.

PRHM7_AHOWSKN1_2 = ~z~What are we looking for?

PRHM7_AHOWSKN1_3 = ~z~Well, I think we should start with something small, don't you? I kill it, you skin it... sound fair?

PRHM7_AHOWSKN1_4 = ~z~Skin it? But I... I don't even have a knife with me.

PRHM7_AHOWSKN1_5 = ~z~Don't worry, you won't need one... now take a look around for any movement.

PRHM7_AL1_HEY_1 = ~z~Er, you alright there?

PRHM7_ALLBOTT1_1 = ~z~Well if you're just here to show off, I'll leave you to it.

PRHM7_ALLBOTT2_1 = ~z~Got a little carried away there, I see.

PRHM7_ALLBOTTKJ_1 = ~z~Well, er, that was quite the show.

PRHM7_ALLBOTTKJ_2 = ~z~It was nice to see you again, but I should be getting on now. All the best.

PRHM7_ALLBOTTK_1 = ~z~Well, at least you tried to help.

PRHM7_ALLBOTTK_2 = ~z~I still have some of the rabbit left that I salted up. Would you join me for a meal? Please, come inside.

PRHM7_ASEEPREY2_1 = ~z~There look, a rabbit. Okay, stay quiet and still. Watch me.

PRHM7_BANT1A_1 = ~z~What happened to your husband, if you don't mind me asking?

PRHM7_BANT1A_2 = ~z~A bear got him... it was horrifying. He survived but only for a couple of days.

PRHM7_BANT1A_3 = ~z~I buried him a week ago.

PRHM7_BANT1A_4 = ~z~I'm sorry.

PRHM7_BANT1A_5 = ~z~This was really his dream more than mine.

PRHM7_BANT1A_6 = ~z~I'd have hopped the next train back to Chicago if he'd said the word... but now...

PRHM7_BANT1A_7 = ~z~I don't know, it's hard to explain... I have to do this.

PRHM7_BANT1A_8 = ~z~I understand.

PRHM7_BANT1J_1 = ~z~What happened to your husband, if you don't mind me asking?

PRHM7_BANT1J_2 = ~z~A bear got him... it was horrifying. He survived but only for a couple of days.

PRHM7_BANT1J_3 = ~z~I buried him a week ago.

PRHM7_BANT1J_4 = ~z~I'm sorry.

PRHM7_BANT1J_5 = ~z~This was really his dream more than mine.

PRHM7_BANT1J_6 = ~z~I'd have hopped the next train back to Chicago if he'd said the word... but now...

PRHM7_BANT1J_7 = ~z~I don't know, it's hard to explain... I have to do this.

PRHM7_BANT1J_8 = ~z~I understand.

PRHM7_BANT2A_1 = ~z~That should keep you fed for a few days.

PRHM7_BANT2A_2 = ~z~Oh yes, at least. Thank you so much.

PRHM7_BANT2A_3 = ~z~I mean this really ain't such a bad spot. You got a good water source.

PRHM7_BANT2A_4 = ~z~It's remote, but you can survive here alright.

PRHM7_BANT2A_5 = ~z~I have no doubt one can survive here... whether Charlotte Balfour can is a different matter entirely.

PRHM7_BANT2A_6 = ~z~You've probably lived your whole life in the outdoors.

PRHM7_BANT2A_7 = ~z~A lot of it, that's for sure.

PRHM7_BANT2A_8 = ~z~I'd barely left the city before coming here.

PRHM7_BANT2A_9 = ~z~Cal spent his summers growing up at his grandparents' lodge in Maine,

PRHM7_BANT2A_10 = ~z~but I get the impression they did more punting than hunting.

PRHM7_BANT2A_11 = ~z~Right.

PRHM7_BANT2J_1 = ~z~That should keep you fed for a few days.

PRHM7_BANT2J_2 = ~z~Oh yes, at least. Thank you so much.

PRHM7_BANT2J_3 = ~z~I mean this really ain't such a bad spot. You got a good water source.

PRHM7_BANT2J_4 = ~z~It's remote, but you can survive here alright.

PRHM7_BANT2J_9 = ~z~Cal spent his summers growing up at his grandparents' lodge in Maine,

PRHM7_BANT2J_10 = ~z~but I get the impression they did more punting than hunting.

PRHM7_BANT2J_11 = ~z~Right.

PRHM7_BANT3A_1 = ~z~Ever since we got here, it feels like every step forward has come with a hundred steps back.

PRHM7_BANT3A_2 = ~z~People always talk about the simplicity of country life. But there's nothing simple about any of this.

PRHM7_BANT3A_3 = ~z~I guess we only know what we know...

PRHM7_BANT3A_4 = ~z~Oh please, I'm sure it wouldn't take you too long to adjust to a life of privilege and indolence in the big city.

PRHM7_BANT3A_5 = ~z~I don't know about that... it sounds awful.

PRHM7_BANT3A_6 = ~z~Oh it is. A truly empty and boring existence... but an undeniably easy one.

PRHM7_BANT3J_1 = ~z~Ever since we got here, it feels like every step forward has come with a hundred steps back.

PRHM7_BANT3J_2 = ~z~People always talk about the simplicity of country life. But there's nothing simple about any of this.

PRHM7_BANT3J_3 = ~z~I guess we only know what we know...

PRHM7_BANT3J_4 = ~z~Oh please, I'm sure it wouldn't take you too long to adjust to a life of privilege and indolence in the big city.

PRHM7_BANT3J_5 = ~z~I don't know about that... it sounds awful.

PRHM7_BANT3J_6 = ~z~Oh it is. A truly empty and boring existence... but an undeniably easy one.

PRHM7_BLOWBOTT_1 = ~z~You maniac, what do you think you're doing?

PRHM7_BUMP1_1 = ~z~Hey, careful.

PRHM7_BUMP2_1 = ~z~Hey, stop it. What's gotten into you?

PRHM7_DAMAG1_1 = ~z~Careful! Watch the house, please.

PRHM7_DAMAG2_1 = ~z~Will you please watch where you're shooting?

PRHM7_DAMAG3_1 = ~z~I don't know what's gotten into you, but I don't appreciate it one bit.

PRHM7_EMPTY_1 = ~z~I wish I could offer more, but as you can see, I don't have much left.

PRHM7_GEE_1 = ~z~Alright, I can do this.

PRHM7_GETAWAY1_01 = ~z~Please, just let me be.

PRHM7_GETAWAY1_02 = ~z~You're acting very strangely.

PRHM7_GETAWAY1_03 = ~z~I think you should leave now.

PRHM7_GOOD_J_1 = ~z~Yes, this is a good spot.

PRHM7_GOOD_J_2 = ~z~What are we looking for?

PRHM7_GOOD_J_3 = ~z~Well, I think we should start with something small, don't you? I kill it, you skin it... sound fair?

PRHM7_GOOD_J_4 = ~z~Skin it? But I... I don't even have a knife with me.

PRHM7_GOOD_J_5 = ~z~Don't worry, you won't need one... now take a look around for any movement.

PRHM7_HAT_1 = ~z~That's an interesting choice of hat, if you don't mind me saying.

PRHM7_HUNTW1_1 = ~z~What are you waiting for?

PRHM7_HUNTW2B_1 = ~z~Look, are we going to hunt or not?

PRHM7_HUNTW2_1 = ~z~Are we going then?

PRHM7_HUNTW3_1 = ~z~I'm sorry, I just don't have the energy to mess around. I'm going back to the house.

PRHM7_IDLE_SINK_1 = ~z~Oh, what a gentleman. Are you going to clean the dishes for me?

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_1 = ~z~You two really thought you could make it out here all by yourselves?

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_2 = ~z~We did. We were fools. Our “little adventure” Cal called it.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_3 = ~z~I was feeling lost and got swept away in the idea. It must all seem ridiculous to you.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_4 = ~z~Hey, we're all trying to run from something.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_5 = ~z~And what are you trying to run from?

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_6 = ~z~You don't want to know, trust me.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN1_7 = ~z~Oh I do... maybe another time.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN2_1 = ~z~Your “little adventure”, really?

PRHM7_ILO_RETN2_2 = ~z~Please, I know how it silly it sounds now. It's hard to explain how... useless we felt... how useless I felt.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN2_3 = ~z~We were stunted and I wanted us to grow again... oh I don't know. I'll never forgive myself.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN2_4 = ~z~Ain't no point blaming yourself for any of this.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN2_5 = ~z~I was supposed to be the one with the level head... but he was so excited.

PRHM7_ILO_RETN2_6 = ~z~Even now it still doesn't seem real. I keep thinking I'll wake up back in Chicago next to him.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_1 = ~z~So it's Chicago you came from?

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_2 = ~z~That's right... have you been?

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_3 = ~z~Yeah, I've passed through a couple of times.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_4 = ~z~Business or pleasure?

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_5 = ~z~Business, you could say. Banking, mostly.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_6 = ~z~Oh really? Cal was in banking too.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_7 = ~z~I doubt we crossed paths. I was more on the withdrawals side.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_8 = ~z~Oh right... you're teasing me.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP1_9 = ~z~Something like that...

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_1 = ~z~Now you're sure I can't take you to a train station?

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_2 = ~z~You just lost your husband, it wouldn't be giving up.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_3 = ~z~No, thank you, but even this is better than the prospect of having to deal with my ghastly family right now, let alone his.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_4 = ~z~See, nothing's that easy.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_5 = ~z~Cal and I were both born into money. Wanting for nothing, yet somehow wanting for everything.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_6 = ~z~Oh what a pathetic sob story it is... you must think I'm such a spoiled brat.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_7 = ~z~Not at all... well, maybe just a little.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_8 = ~z~No, I came here with Cal and I'm staying here with him.

PRHM7_ILO_RETP2_9 = ~z~Alright then...

PRHM7_JHOWSKN1_1 = ~z~Yes, this is a good spot.

PRHM7_JHOWSKN1_2 = ~z~What are we looking for?

PRHM7_JHOWSKN1_3 = ~z~Well, I think we should start with something small, don't you? I kill it, you skin it... sound fair?

PRHM7_JHOWSKN1_4 = ~z~Skin it? But I... I don't even have a knife with me.

PRHM7_JHOWSKN1_5 = ~z~Don't worry, you won't need one... now take a look around for any movement.

PRHM7_JILORETN1_1 = ~z~You two really thought you could make it out here all by yourselves?

PRHM7_JILORETN1_2 = ~z~We did. We were fools. Our “little adventure” Cal called it.

PRHM7_JILORETN1_3 = ~z~I was feeling lost and got swept away in the idea. It must all seem ridiculous to you.

PRHM7_JILORETN1_4 = ~z~Hey, we're all trying to run from something.

PRHM7_JILORETN1_5 = ~z~And what are you trying to run from?

PRHM7_JILORETN1_6 = ~z~You don't want to know, trust me.

PRHM7_JILORETN1_7 = ~z~Oh I do... maybe another time.

PRHM7_JILORETN2_1 = ~z~Your “little adventure”, really?

PRHM7_JILORETN2_2 = ~z~Please, I know how it silly it sounds now. It's hard to explain how... useless we felt... how useless I felt.

PRHM7_JILORETN2_3 = ~z~We were stunted and I wanted us to grow again... oh I don't know. I'll never forgive myself.

PRHM7_JILORETN2_4 = ~z~Ain't no point blaming yourself for any of this.

PRHM7_JILORETN2_5 = ~z~I was supposed to be the one with the level head... but he was so excited.

PRHM7_JILORETN2_6 = ~z~Even now it still doesn't seem real. I keep thinking I'll wake up back in Chicago next to him.

PRHM7_JILORETP1_1 = ~z~So it's Chicago you came from?

PRHM7_JILORETP1_2 = ~z~That's right... have you been?

PRHM7_JILORETP1_3 = ~z~Yeah, I've passed through a couple of times.

PRHM7_JILORETP1_4 = ~z~Business or pleasure?

PRHM7_JILORETP1_5 = ~z~Business, you could say. Banking, mostly.

PRHM7_JILORETP2_3 = ~z~No, thank you, but even this is better than the prospect of having to deal with my ghastly family right now, let alone his.

PRHM7_JILORETP2_6 = ~z~Oh what a pathetic sob story it is... you must think I'm such a spoiled brat.

PRHM7_JILORETP2_7 = ~z~Not at all... well, maybe just a little.

PRHM7_JILORETP2_8 = ~z~No, I came here with Cal and I'm staying here with him.

PRHM7_JILORETP2_9 = ~z~Alright then...

PRHM7_JL1_HEY_1 = ~z~You alright?

PRHM7_JSEEPREY2_1 = ~z~There look, a rabbit. Okay, stay quiet and still. Watch me.

PRHM7_LEAVDINN_1 = ~z~Leaving already? I promise my cooking tastes better than it looks.

PRHM7_NOFLLW11_1 = ~z~Are you coming?

PRHM7_NOFLLW12_1 = ~z~Come on, it's just up this way.

PRHM7_NOFLLW21_1 = ~z~I suppose I'll just have to wait for you here, then.

PRHM7_OOB_A1_1 = ~z~I thought you said that was a good spot?

PRHM7_OOB_A2_1 = ~z~Should we at least try our luck before moving on?

PRHM7_OOB_A3_1 = ~z~I think I did see something move back there... maybe it's worth another look?

PRHM7_OUTFIT_1 = ~z~That's quite the attire. I am clearly behind the fashions out here.

PRHM7_ROOM1_1 = ~z~Sorry I can't give you a tour. There's just not much to see.

PRHM7_ROOM2_1 = ~z~The guest room... not that I've had many of those.

PRHM7_RTNDINN_1 = ~z~Oh good, you're back. The least I can do is serve you a hot meal.

PRHM7_RTNGRAVE_1 = ~z~I still can't believe he's gone.

PRHM7_RUNARND_01 = ~z~Where are you going?

PRHM7_RUNARND_02 = ~z~What are we doing?

PRHM7_RUNARND_03 = ~z~What are you chasing?

PRHM7_SHOOTPED_1 = ~z~Oh my God, you're insane!

PRHM7_SKINST_A_1 = ~z~Just give it a sharp pull.

PRHM7_TOOFAST11_1 = ~z~Wait, sorry, I don't have the energy to go that fast.

PRHM7_TOOFAST12_1 = ~z~Seriously, I can only move so fast.

PRHM7_TOOFAST21_1 = ~z~Sorry I'm so slow, I'm sure you're in a rush to get going.

PRHM7_WSEEPRE2A_1 = ~z~Look, a rabbit! Right there!

PRHM7_WSEEPRE2A_2 = ~z~Yes, good eye. Okay, stay quiet and still. Watch me.

PRHM7_WSEEPRE2J_1 = ~z~Look, a rabbit! Right there!

PRHM7_WSEEPRE2J_2 = ~z~Yes, good eye. Okay, stay quiet and still. Watch me.

PRHM7_W_FLEE_1 = ~z~No, please! You leave me alone!

P_R7_AILO_P_SK1_1 = ~z~That's it, go on.

P_R7_A_RETURN_1 = ~z~Sure, I'll walk you back. You did good.

P_R7_A_RMD_SHT1_1 = ~z~I'll shoot a few more this time.

P_R7_A_SHOFOCUS_1 = ~z~Not bad. Focus on the inhale, shoot on the exhale. My turn...

P_R7_A_SHOOTTIP_1 = ~z~Okay... calm and steady... don't snatch at the trigger.

P_R7_A_SHOT1_1 = ~z~Alright, you try now. Remember to breathe.

P_R7_A_SKINTIME_1 = ~z~Got it.

P_R7_A_SKINTIME_2 = ~z~Oh, good shot.

P_R7_A_SKINTIME_3 = ~z~Okay then, go on. Time to get your hands dirty.

P_R7_A_SKINTIME_4 = ~z~How do I... I mean... what do I do?

P_R7_A_SKINTIME_5 = ~z~Just hold the legs tight, and pull the skin away, quickly. Should come right off.

P_R7_A_THXAJ_1 = ~z~Well, nature provides, but she sure don't always make it easy.

P_R7_A_WOLF_SEE_1 = ~z~Wolves! Stay back! Must have smelled the dead rabbit.

P_R7_IG2_JSKN_B_1 = ~z~And that is all there is to it. You did good.

P_R7_IG2_JSKN_B_2 = ~z~I think I've seen enough blood for one day. Do you mind if we head back now?

P_R7_IG2_SKIN_B_1 = ~z~And that is all there is to it. You did good.

P_R7_IG2_SKIN_B_2 = ~z~I think I've seen enough blood for one day. Do you mind if we head back now?

P_R7_JILO_P_SK1_1 = ~z~That's it, go on.

P_R7_JWOLFDED1_1 = ~z~Oh thank God. You see? If you hadn't been here, I'd be dead now.

P_R7_JWOLFDED1_2 = ~z~You got a rifle?

P_R7_JWOLFDED1_3 = ~z~Yes... well, my husband's.

P_R7_JWOLFDED1_4 = ~z~I suggest you learn how to use it. Now come on, let's get you home.

P_R7_J_RETURN_1 = ~z~Sure, I'll walk you back. You did good.

P_R7_J_RMD_SHT1_1 = ~z~I'll shoot a few more this time.

P_R7_J_SHOFOCUS_1 = ~z~Not bad. Focus on the inhale, shoot on the exhale. My turn...

P_R7_J_SHOOTTIP_1 = ~z~Okay... calm and steady... don't snatch at the trigger.

P_R7_J_SHOT1_1 = ~z~Alright, you try now. Remember to breathe.

P_R7_J_SHOTHIT_1 = ~z~Glad I could help, ma'am. Good luck.

P_R7_J_SKINTIME_1 = ~z~Got it.

P_R7_J_SKINTIME_2 = ~z~Oh, good shot.

P_R7_J_SKINTIME_3 = ~z~Okay then, go on. Time to get your hands dirty.

P_R7_J_SKINTIME_4 = ~z~How do I... I mean... what do I do?

P_R7_J_SKINTIME_5 = ~z~Just hold the legs tight, and pull the skin away, quickly. Should come right off.

P_R7_J_WOLF_SEE_1 = ~z~Wolves! Stay back! Must have smelled the dead rabbit.

P_R7_MCS1_1 = ~z~Who are you?

P_R7_MCS1_2 = ~z~Oh, it's okay ma'am...

P_R7_MCS1_3 = ~z~I don't mean you no harm.

P_R7_MCS1_4 = ~z~Well it makes no difference now...

P_R7_MCS1_5 = ~z~if an outlaw or wild animal doesn't get me...

P_R7_MCS1_6 = ~z~starvation will.

P_R7_MCS1_7 = ~z~We came out here from the city in search of a different life.

P_R7_MCS1_8 = ~z~Something...

P_R7_MCS1_9 = ~z~true, something...

P_R7_MCS1_10 = ~z~real.

P_R7_MCS1_11 = ~z~All this squandering and indulgence...

P_R7_MCS1_12 = ~z~we wanted to strip it away to...

P_R7_MCS1_13 = ~z~find something authentic.

P_R7_MCS1_14 = ~z~What a pair of fools.

P_R7_MCS1_15 = ~z~Is there a train station or a town I can take you to?

P_R7_MCS1_16 = ~z~No, I can't give up now.

P_R7_MCS1_17 = ~z~He wouldn't want that, I...

P_R7_MCS1_18 = ~z~I can't have it.

P_R7_MCS1_19 = ~z~I'm gonna do this for you...

P_R7_MCS1_20 = ~z~Cal.

P_R7_MCS1_21 = ~z~Well...

P_R7_MCS1_22 = ~z~I'll, erm...

P_R7_MCS1_23 = ~z~I'll leave you to it.

P_R7_MCS1_24 = ~z~Is there anything left for you to eat?

P_R7_MCS1_25 = ~z~Nothing.

P_R7_MCS1_26 = ~z~No, we didn't know the first thing about hunting, we...

P_R7_MCS1_27 = ~z~couldn't even catch a darn mouse.

P_R7_MCS1_28 = ~z~If you need any poisonous berries, though...

P_R7_MCS1_29 = ~z~I'm a natural at finding those.

P_R7_MCS1_30 = ~z~Well...

P_R7_MCS1_31 = ~z~you ain't gonna last much longer out here...

P_R7_MCS1_32 = ~z~if you don't know how to hunt.

P_R7_MCS1_33 = ~z~Come on.

P_R7_MCS1_34 = ~z~I'll show you.

P_R7_MCS1_35 = ~z~Alright.

P_R7_MCS1_36 = ~z~But you'd better not try any funny business.

P_R7_MCS1_37 = ~z~You know I may be weak...

P_R7_MCS1_38 = ~z~but I still know how to stand up for myself.

P_R7_MCS1_39 = ~z~Oh, I don't doubt it.

P_R7_MCS1_40 = ~z~Come on.

P_R7_MCS1_41 = ~z~Oh, it-it's ok, ma'am...

P_R7_MCS1_42 = ~z~I mean you no harm.

P_R7_MCS1_43 = ~z~Is there a train station...

P_R7_MCS1_44 = ~z~or a town I can take you to?

P_R7_MCS1_45 = ~z~Well...

P_R7_MCS1_46 = ~z~I'll, err...

P_R7_MCS1_47 = ~z~I'll leave you to it.

P_R7_MCS1_48 = ~z~Is there anything left for you to eat?

P_R7_MCS1_49 = ~z~Well...

P_R7_MCS1_50 = ~z~you ain't gonna last much longer out here...

P_R7_MCS1_51 = ~z~if you don't know how to hunt.

P_R7_MCS1_52 = ~z~Come on.

P_R7_MCS1_53 = ~z~I'll show ya.

P_R7_MCS1_54 = ~z~Oh, I don't doubt it.

P_R7_MCS1_55 = ~z~Come on.

P_R7_MCS1_LIJ_1 = ~z~Who are you?

P_R7_MCS1_LIJ_2 = ~z~Oh, i-it's okay, ma'am. I mean you no harm.

P_R7_MCS1_LIJ_3 = ~z~

P_R7_MCS1_LIJ_4 = ~z~Well, it makes no difference now...

P_R7_MCS1_LI_1 = ~z~Who are you?

P_R7_MCS1_LI_2 = ~z~Oh, it's okay, ma'am. I don't mean you no harm.

P_R7_MCS1_LI_3 = ~z~

P_R7_MCS1_LI_4 = ~z~Well, it makes no difference now...

P_R7_MCS1_LOJ_1 = ~z~Tell me, you ever skinned an animal before?

P_R7_MCS1_LOOPA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5:1~This was supposed to be our little adventure...

P_R7_MCS1_LOOPB_1 = ~z~All we need is each other... that's what you said.

P_R7_MCS1_LOOPC_1 = ~z~You promised you'd never leave me...

P_R7_MCS1_LO_1 = ~z~Tell me, you ever skinned an animal before?

P_R7_MCS1_SOBS_1 = ~z~

P_R7_MCS1_SOBS_2 = ~z~

P_R7_MCS1_WHAT_1 = ~z~What?

P_R7_MCS2LI_1 = ~z~Oh hey there!

P_R7_MCS2LI_2 = ~z~How you feeling, ma'am?

P_R7_MCS2LI_3 = ~z~Much better than I've felt in a long time, I...

P_R7_MCS2LI_4 = ~z~if we hadn't caught that rabbit, I don't think I'd have made it another day.

P_R7_MCS2LI_J_1 = ~z~Oh hey there!

P_R7_MCS2LI_J_2 = ~z~How you feeling, ma'am?

P_R7_MCS2LI_J_3 = ~z~Much better than I've felt in a long time, I...

P_R7_MCS2LI_J_4 = ~z~if we hadn't caught that rabbit, I don't think I'd have made it another day.

P_R7_MCS2_1 = ~z~Oh, hey there.

P_R7_MCS2_2 = ~z~How you feeling, ma'am?

P_R7_MCS2_3 = ~z~Much better than I've felt in a long time, I...

P_R7_MCS2_4 = ~z~if we hadn't caught that rabbit...

P_R7_MCS2_5 = ~z~I don't think I'd have made it another day.

P_R7_MCS2_6 = ~z~Well you look better.

P_R7_MCS2_7 = ~z~Better and determined...

P_R7_MCS2_8 = ~z~thanks to you.

P_R7_MCS2_9 = ~z~And if I'm gonna learn to hunt, I figured it was...

P_R7_MCS2_10 = ~z~time I learned how to use Cal's gun properly.

P_R7_MCS2_11 = ~z~And how's that working out for ya?

P_R7_MCS2_12 = ~z~Well, let's just say my prey is looking decidedly unscathed.

P_R7_MCS2_13 = ~z~But the end of labor is to gain leisure...

P_R7_MCS2_14 = ~z~is that not what Aristotle said?

P_R7_MCS2_15 = ~z~Well, I...

P_R7_MCS2_16 = ~z~I don't know much about...

P_R7_MCS2_17 = ~z~Aristotle, but erm...

P_R7_MCS2_18 = ~z~I know a thing or two about shooting a gun.

P_R7_MCS2_19 = ~z~Look...

P_R7_MCS2_20 = ~z~you gotta...

P_R7_MCS2_21 = ~z~hold steady...

P_R7_MCS2_22 = ~z~and firm.

P_R7_MCS2_23 = ~z~You just focus...

P_R7_MCS2_24 = ~z~breathe slowly...

P_R7_MCS2_25 = ~z~and always pull the trigger on empty lungs.

P_R7_MCS2_26 = ~z~Here, I'll show ya.

P_R7_MCS2_27 = ~z~How you feeling, ma'am?

P_R7_MCS2_28 = ~z~Well you look better.

P_R7_MCS2_29 = ~z~How's that working out for ya?

P_R7_MCS2_30 = ~z~Well, I...

P_R7_MCS2_31 = ~z~I don't know much about Aristotle, but err...

P_R7_MCS2_32 = ~z~I know a thing or two about shooting a gun.

P_R7_MCS2_33 = ~z~Look...

P_R7_MCS2_34 = ~z~you gotta...

P_R7_MCS2_35 = ~z~you gotta hold steady...

P_R7_MCS2_36 = ~z~and firm.

P_R7_MCS2_37 = ~z~You just focus...

P_R7_MCS2_38 = ~z~breathe slowly...

P_R7_MCS2_39 = ~z~and always pull the trigger on empty lungs.

P_R7_MCS2_40 = ~z~Here, I'll show ya.

P_R7_MCS2_LOOPA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4:1~Gosh darnit! Not a single one...

P_R7_MCS2_LOOPB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.6~Terrible.

P_R7_MCS2_LOOPC_1 = ~z~~sl:0.9:1.3:1~How hard can it be?

P_R7_MCS3_1 = ~z~Well it's, it's good and hot.

P_R7_MCS3_2 = ~z~I hope you enjoy it.

P_R7_MCS3_3 = ~z~You helped me to catch it after all.

P_R7_MCS3_4 = ~z~Bon appetit.

P_R7_MCS3_5 = ~z~Huh?

P_R7_MCS3_6 = ~z~Please, enjoy.

P_R7_MCS3_7 = ~z~And thank you again for everything...

P_R7_MCS3_8 = ~z~I really am grateful.

P_R7_MCS3_9 = ~z~It was nothing.

P_R7_MCS3_10 = ~z~You're a good man.

P_R7_MCS3_11 = ~z~Oh, you don't really know me.

P_R7_MCS3_12 = ~z~I know enough.

P_R7_MCS3_13 = ~z~There's always more to find in ourselves...

P_R7_MCS3_14 = ~z~you helped me to see that.

P_R7_MCS3_15 = ~z~My husband, Cal, was such an optimist...

P_R7_MCS3_16 = ~z~I found that to be very contagious...

P_R7_MCS3_17 = ~z~but there's a fine line between optimism and naivete.

P_R7_MCS3_18 = ~z~We were both born with the silver spoon...

P_R7_MCS3_19 = ~z~banquets, butlers, valets...

P_R7_MCS3_20 = ~z~Sounds terrible.

P_R7_MCS3_21 = ~z~It was just...

P_R7_MCS3_22 = ~z~so many people...

P_R7_MCS3_23 = ~z~so many things.

P_R7_MCS3_24 = ~z~I was lost in it, I was...

P_R7_MCS3_25 = ~z~crushed by it.

P_R7_MCS3_26 = ~z~My father was very...

P_R7_MCS3_27 = ~z~overbearing.

P_R7_MCS3_28 = ~z~Then we came out here and I got crushed by this.

P_R7_MCS3_29 = ~z~You know I pictured myself...

P_R7_MCS3_30 = ~z~picking fresh vegetables...

P_R7_MCS3_31 = ~z~sipping homemade wine...

P_R7_MCS3_32 = ~z~writing a great novel...

P_R7_MCS3_33 = ~z~but I turned out to be a far more pathetic anti-heroine...

P_R7_MCS3_34 = ~z~than any I could ever pen.

P_R7_MCS3_35 = ~z~Ah well...

P_R7_MCS3_36 = ~z~I reckon you're gonna be just fine.

P_R7_MCS3_37 = ~z~Are you alright?

P_R7_MCS3_38 = ~z~Can I get you some water?

P_R7_MCS3_39 = ~z~No, I'm, I'm, I'm fine.

P_R7_MCS3_40 = ~z~I just um...

P_R7_MCS3_41 = ~z~Yeah, thank you for this...

P_R7_MCS3_42 = ~z~I think it's, it's best if I ju...

P_R7_MCS3_43 = ~z~If I make...

P_R7_MCS3_44 = ~z~S-Stay right there, it's, it's gonna be okay.

P_R7_MCS3_45 = ~z~My Dear Arthur,

P_R7_MCS3_46 = ~z~I have gone out hunting.

P_R7_MCS3_47 = ~z~Not a phrase I thought any...

P_R7_MCS3_48 = ~z~pen of mine would ever ink.

P_R7_MCS3_49 = ~z~But, nonetheless one I'm very proud...

P_R7_MCS3_50 = ~z~to finally be able to write.

P_R7_MCS3_51 = ~z~I am so very grateful to you for all the help...

P_R7_MCS3_52 = ~z~and encouragement you've given me.

P_R7_MCS3_53 = ~z~There is some money in a box on the nightstand.

P_R7_MCS3_54 = ~z~Please take it.

P_R7_MCS3_55 = ~z~I have far more than I need back in the city...

P_R7_MCS3_56 = ~z~and I'd like you to have it.

P_R7_MCS3_57 = ~z~Please take care...

P_R7_MCS3_58 = ~z~and remain true to the man I know you are.

P_R7_MCS3_LO_1 = ~z~Yours fondly, Charlotte.

P_R7_MCS3_LO_2 = ~z~

P_R7_MCS5_1 = ~z~My, my...

P_R7_MCS5_2 = ~z~I was wondering when I was gonna see you again.

P_R7_MCS5_3 = ~z~You look...

P_R7_MCS5_4 = ~z~different.

P_R7_MCS5_5 = ~z~Well, the rigors of simplicity take their toll on a woman.

P_R7_MCS5_6 = ~z~Oh no, I didn't mean it like...

P_R7_MCS5_7 = ~z~I know.

P_R7_MCS5_8 = ~z~Things are going well.

P_R7_MCS5_9 = ~z~I couldn't have done it without you.

P_R7_MCS5_10 = ~z~You did it all yourself.

P_R7_MCS5_11 = ~z~So, how are you holding up?

P_R7_MCS5_12 = ~z~I'm still standing...

P_R7_MCS5_13 = ~z~which is an improvement on the last time you saw me.

P_R7_MCS5_14 = ~z~I wish that there was something else that I could do.

P_R7_MCS5_15 = ~z~Ma'am...

P_R7_MCS5_16 = ~z~you have done more than enough.

P_R7_MCS5_17 = ~z~Please...

P_R7_MCS5_18 = ~z~call me Charlotte.

P_R7_MCS5_19 = ~z~Arthur.

P_R7_MCS5_20 = ~z~Arthur Morgan.

P_R7_MCS5_21 = ~z~Well...

P_R7_MCS5_22 = ~z~you take care of yourself, Arthur.

P_R7_MCS6_1 = ~z~Hello there.

P_R7_MCS6_2 = ~z~Can I help you?

P_R7_MCS6_3 = ~z~I think you knew a friend of mine...

P_R7_MCS6_4 = ~z~feller called Arthur Morgan...

P_R7_MCS6_5 = ~z~came by and helped you with some hunting and skinning...

P_R7_MCS6_6 = ~z~probably seven or eight years back.

P_R7_MCS6_7 = ~z~Yes, of course...

P_R7_MCS6_8 = ~z~I wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for him.

P_R7_MCS6_9 = ~z~Unfortunately he passed soon after.

P_R7_MCS6_10 = ~z~I figured he might not have had long left...

P_R7_MCS6_11 = ~z~such a shame.

P_R7_MCS6_12 = ~z~He found me at my lowest point and he lifted me up.

P_R7_MCS6_13 = ~z~Glad to see you're doing well, ma'am.

P_R7_MCS6_14 = ~z~He wrote fondly of you.

P_R7_MCS6_15 = ~z~Oh I couldn't be happier.

P_R7_MCS6_16 = ~z~Listen... it's a long way out here...

P_R7_MCS6_17 = ~z~you're welcome to take whatever you need...

P_R7_MCS6_18 = ~z~from the house for your travels.

P_R7_MCS6_19 = ~z~No, no, that ain't necessary.

P_R7_MCS6_20 = ~z~Please, I have everything I need and more.

P_R7_MCS6_21 = ~z~He gave me the ability to survive...

P_R7_MCS6_22 = ~z~and now I'm writing.

P_R7_MCS6_23 = ~z~Any friend of Arthur's is a friend of mine.

P_R7_MCS6_LI_1 = ~z~Hello there.

P_R7_MCS6_LI_2 = ~z~Can I help you?

P_R7_MCS6_LO_1 = ~z~Please take something... it would make me happy.

P_R7_MCS6_LO_2 = ~z~Well, that's... very kind of you, ma'am.

P_R7_MSC3_LI_1 = ~z~Well it's... it's good and hot.

P_R7_MSC3_LI_2 = ~z~I hope you enjoy it.

P_R7_MSC3_LI_3 = ~z~You helped me to catch it after all.

P_R7_MSC5_LO_1 = ~z~Well please, go on in and help yourself to anything you need.

P_R7_MSC5_LO_2 = ~z~What's mine is yours.

P_R7_MSC5_LO_3 = ~z~Oh... well, that's very kind.

P_R7_NEWSKIN_1_1 = ~z~Oh my... it worked.

P_R7_WOLFDEAD1_1 = ~z~Oh thank God. You see? If you hadn't been here, I'd be dead now.

P_R7_WOLFDEAD1_2 = ~z~You got a rifle?

P_R7_WOLFDEAD1_3 = ~z~Yes... well, my husband's.

P_R7_WOLFDEAD1_4 = ~z~I suggest you learn how to use it. Now come on, let's get you home.

P_R7_W_AIMATHER_1 = ~z~Wh - what are you doing?

P_R7_W_AIMREACT_1 = ~z~Come on, don't do this... please.

P_R7_W_CATCH_11_1 = ~z~Oh no, it's hopping away.

P_R7_W_CATCH_12_1 = ~z~Quick, get him!

P_R7_W_CATCH_13_1 = ~z~He's a fast one.

P_R7_W_CATCH_14_1 = ~z~It's getting away!

P_R7_W_CHALLENG_1 = ~z~Oh no, that wretched rat is back. Over there, you see?

P_R7_W_CHALLENG_2 = ~z~It's been a thorn on my side even since we moved here. Kill it, please.

P_R7_W_COMING_1 = ~z~Are you coming or not?

P_R7_W_DRAMATIC_1 = ~z~The pause for dramatic effect, a true showman.

P_R7_W_EXHAUSTB_1 = ~z~Well, don't stand on ceremony. Please, sit down.

P_R7_W_EXHAUSTC_1 = ~z~Well, I won't keep badgering you. Just sit down when you're ready.

P_R7_W_EXHAUST_1 = ~z~Are you sure you don't want to sit down?

P_R7_W_EXHAUST_2 = ~z~You look exhausted.

P_R7_W_GIVUPFLW_1 = ~z~I'll go on ahead if you don't mind... I'm very tired.

P_R7_W_GOON_1 = ~z~Well, go on then.

P_R7_W_INTHEWA2_1 = ~z~Would you move to the side? You're making me nervous.

P_R7_W_INTHEWA3_1 = ~z~Move over, you're right in my line.

P_R7_W_INTHEWAY_1 = ~z~That doesn't seem like the best place for you to position yourself.

P_R7_W_JSHOTHIT_1 = ~z~What can I say? Thank you again.

P_R7_W_JSHOTHIT_2 = ~z~You've helped me so much.

P_R7_W_JSHOTHIT_3 = ~z~I won't waste what you've taught me. Who knows... maybe in the future I can repay you somehow.

P_R7_W_JSURVIVB_1 = ~z~No, but then again, I haven't caught much of anything either.

P_R7_W_JSURVIVB_2 = ~z~Well, you'll need to know how to do both if you're going to survive out here.

P_R7_W_JSURVIVB_3 = ~z~I am all too aware. So where should we head for?

P_R7_W_JSURVIVB_4 = ~z~Let's try in the trees down there, near the river.

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_1 = ~z~Thank you. That was the first time anyone's done anything nice for us...

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_2 = ~z~for me... since we got here.

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_3 = ~z~Well, nature provides, but she sure don't always make it easy.

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_4 = ~z~That she doesn't.

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_5 = ~z~I'd invite you in, but I'm dead on my feet, if you'll forgive the pun.

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_6 = ~z~Please do call again some time, though. A good rest and hopefully I'll be a new woman.

P_R7_W_JTHXHNT_7 = ~z~Alright, ma'am, you take care now.

P_R7_W_LETSEEIT_1 = ~z~Alright, let's see it.

P_R7_W_LILMISSA_1 = ~z~Wait to breathe out, wait to breathe out...

P_R7_W_LILMISSB_1 = ~z~Would you look at that? I haven't hit one that close all day!

P_R7_W_LILMISS_1 = ~z~Wait to breathe out, wait to breathe out...

P_R7_W_LILMISS_2 = ~z~Would you look at that? I haven't hit one that close all day.

P_R7_W_LOITKIL1_1 = ~z~Okay, I'm watching?

P_R7_W_LOITKIL2_1 = ~z~Er, so, what are you waiting for?

P_R7_W_LOITKIL3_1 = ~z~Shouldn't you shoot it now, before it runs away?

P_R7_W_LOITKIL4_1 = ~z~Sorry, I'll keep quiet. You know best, after all.

P_R7_W_OHDEAR_1 = ~z~Oh dear... what happened there?

P_R7_W_OHNO_1 = ~z~Oh. Oh...

P_R7_W_OUTOFWAY_1 = ~z~Okay, it's my shot.

P_R7_W_QUICKDRW_1 = ~z~Well, this clearly isn't a lesson in quick-draw.

P_R7_W_RATLIVES_1 = ~z~It got away! I told you it was fast. Anyway, my turn.

P_R7_W_SEAT_1 = ~z~Go ahead and take a seat at the table. Food is just about done.

P_R7_W_SHOBLAH1_1 = ~z~Well, if even you struggle sometimes, maybe I shouldn't feel so hard on myself.

P_R7_W_SHOBLAH2_1 = ~z~Alright, finally... not that I could do any better.

P_R7_W_SHOGOOD1_1 = ~z~You make it look so easy.

P_R7_W_SHOGOOD2_1 = ~z~Showoff. Alright, let me try again.

P_R7_W_SHOTHITA_1 = ~z~Come on, come on...

P_R7_W_SHOTHITB_1 = ~z~

P_R7_W_SHOTHITB_2 = ~z~Yes! I hit it! I hit it, didn't I?

P_R7_W_SHOTHITC_1 = ~z~What can I say? Thank you.

P_R7_W_SHOTHITC_2 = ~z~I still have some of the rabbit left that I salted up...

P_R7_W_SHOTHITC_3 = ~z~Would you join me for a meal? It's the least I can do...

P_R7_W_SHWAIT13_1 = ~z~Well, if it takes this long, no wonder I've been doing it wrong.

P_R7_W_SHWAIT23_1 = ~z~At what point does focus turn into too much focus?

P_R7_W_SURVIVEB_1 = ~z~No, but then again, I haven't caught much of anything either.

P_R7_W_SURVIVEB_2 = ~z~Well, you'll need to know how to do both if you're going to survive out here.

P_R7_W_SURVIVEB_3 = ~z~I am all too aware. So where should we head for?

P_R7_W_SURVIVEB_4 = ~z~Let's try in the trees down there, near the river.

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_1 = ~z~Thank you. That was the first time anyone's done anything nice for us...

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_2 = ~z~for me... since we got here.

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_3 = ~z~Well, nature provides, but she sure don't always make it easy.

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_4 = ~z~That she doesn't.

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_5 = ~z~I'd invite you in, but I'm dead on my feet, if you'll forgive the pun.

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_6 = ~z~Please do call again some time, though. A good rest and hopefully I'll be a new woman.

P_R7_W_THXHUNT_7 = ~z~You take care, ma'am.

P_R7_W_TIED_1 = ~z~No, let me go!

P_R7_W_WHAT_1 = ~z~What on earth are you doing?

P_R7_W_WOLFATK1_1 = ~z~Do something, please!

P_R7_W_WOLFATK2_1 = ~z~They're getting closer.

P_R7_W_WOLFATK3_1 = ~z~They're going to kill us!

P_R7_W_WOLFWRN1_1 = ~z~What are we going to do?

P_R7_W_WOLF_SEE_1 = ~z~Oh Lord, no, we're done for now.

P_R7_W_YOUNEED_1 = ~z~Looks like you need some practice yourself.

R7_CAREFUL1_1 = ~z~Woah, careful. Maybe move forward a little.

R7_CAREFUL2_1 = ~z~Please, I really don't feel safe with you shooting from back there.

R7_CARRIED1_1 = ~z~What are you doing? Put me down!

R7_CARRIED2_1 = ~z~Put me down! Now!

R7_CARRIED3_1 = ~z~Please, just stop!

R7_HOGTIED1_1 = ~z~What are you doing? Let me go!

R7_HOGTIED2_1 = ~z~Come on. Untie me, please!

R7_HOGTIED3_1 = ~z~I don't understand. Why are you doing this?

R7_LEAD_GETAWAY_1 = ~z~No, you get away from me!

R7_RTRNDINNER1_1 = ~z~Oh you finally got hungry? Good.

R7_RTRNDINNER2_1 = ~z~Well, I didn't think I'd see you again. Please, sit down and, and let me give you that meal I promised.

R7_SHOOTCHEAT1_1 = ~z~Well, I don't think that counts.

R7_SHOOTCHEAT2_1 = ~z~Okay, I don't think this is such a good idea after all.

R7_TOOCLOSE1_1 = ~z~Aren't you a little close there?

R7_TOOCLOSE2_1 = ~z~Can I get a bit more room here, please?
