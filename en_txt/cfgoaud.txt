ODR_ILO_GAGRT_02 = ~z~Now, who we got here?

ODR_ILO_PAANT_01 = ~z~I was hoping you'd get your hackles up. Idiots.

ODR_ILO_PAANT_02 = ~z~The tough guy act ain't convincing, feller. Not at all.

ODR_ILO_PACAL_01 = ~z~Guess even two-bit outlaws need a rest.

ODR_ILO_PACAL_02 = ~z~Never seen so many idiots around one campfire.

ODR_ILO_PADEF_01 = ~z~Okay. Alright. I'll be on my way.

ODR_ILO_RAGRT_02 = ~z~Need my advice on any of this?

ODR_PACLEAR_01 = ~z~Guess it's my camp now.

ODR_PACLEAR_02 = ~z~If only they'd been friendly.

ODR_PLANB1_0_1 = ~z~Alright, we'll go in the back, then we come out the front. They'll never expect it.

ODR_PLANB1_0_2 = ~z~Come out the front?

ODR_PLANB1_1_1 = ~z~That's where the deputies is.

ODR_PLANB1_2_1 = ~z~Then we go in the front and come out the back, then.

ODR_PLANB1_4_1 = ~z~But then we going back on ourselves.

ODR_PLANB1_4_2 = ~z~Front, back, sideways, dressed up as hogs, make a damn decision.

ODR_PLANB1_7_1 = ~z~Alright, I got it... I got it, we go in the back, and then send you out front to meet the deputy.

ODR_PLANB1_8_1 = ~z~Alright... okay... hold on a sec', that's gonna get my toes curled up.

ODR_PLANB1_9_1 = ~z~You got a problem with that? 'Cos you in the wrong gang if you do.

ODR_PLANB1_10_1 = ~z~I don't have a problem with getting curled up... I'd just rather not.

ODR_PLANB1_11_1 = ~z~Call yourself a man?

ODR_PLANB1_11_2 = ~z~More a man than you ever was.

ODR_PLANB1_13_1 = ~z~

ODR_PLANB1_13_2 = ~z~Alright, if you're too yellow, I guess we get back to planning, then.

ODR_PLANB1_14_1 = ~z~You got us a plan yet? Or you just letting out gas?

ODR_PLANB1_14_2 = ~z~Quit your hollering!

ODR_PLANB1_14_3 = ~z~We ain't got a plan, we're just gonna wing it. Now everyone bunk down for the night.

ODR_PLANB1_16_1 = ~z~I said, bunk down.

ODR_PLANB1_16_2 = ~z~Alright, alright, I heard ya.

ODR_PLANB2_0_1 = ~z~Right here. That's where we dry gulch 'em.

ODR_PLANB2_1_1 = ~z~How we going to get 'em to stop?

ODR_PLANB2_2_1 = ~z~The usual way, with a six shooter.

ODR_PLANB2_3_1 = ~z~W-what if they keep on going? Or if they speed up when they see the iron?

ODR_PLANB2_3_2 = ~z~Well, shit, I don't know.

ODR_PLANB2_5_1 = ~z~How 'bout you do your planning with your traps closed, eh?

ODR_PLANB2_6_1 = ~z~Wait, I got-I got an idea... what if one of us would lay in the road and pretend to be sick-like?

ODR_PLANB2_7_1 = ~z~These killers ain't gonna stop for no invalid. They don't want no consumption.

ODR_PLANB2_8_1 = ~z~Well, they might not stop for you and me, but they might stop for a lady.

ODR_PLANB2_9_1 = ~z~Where are we gonna find a lady?

ODR_PLANB2_10_1 = ~z~Well, you're about the right size?

ODR_PLANB2_11_1 = ~z~You are gonna take that back.

ODR_PLANB2_11_2 = ~z~Look, I think you just might look good in a dress, is all.

ODR_PLANB2_13_1 = ~z~If you fellers don't like the plan, then we can think on something else.

ODR_PLANB2_14_1 = ~z~If I gotta to hear one more idiot idea out your mouths...

ODR_PLANB2_14_2 = ~z~Hey! What you hollering for?

ODR_PLANB2_14_3 = ~z~Ain't these boys faults they're as dumb as rocks.

ODR_PLANB2_16_1 = ~z~Now let's get some shut eye, we'll figure this out in the morning.

ODR_PLANB2_16_2 = ~z~Alright. We'll leave it.

ODR_POLIB1_0_1 = ~z~All I'm saying... is that just 'cos Colm says we gotta do something, doesn't mean we gotta do it.

ODR_POLIB1_1_1 = ~z~Colm says stay off the drink,

ODR_POLIB1_1_2 = ~z~says, stay off the whoring.

ODR_POLIB1_2_1 = ~z~Stay outta Valentine.

ODR_POLIB1_3_1 = ~z~Well... shit! Maybe we don't want to.

ODR_POLIB1_4_1 = ~z~Maybe we wanna get our peckers pulled.

ODR_POLIB1_4_2 = ~z~

ODR_POLIB1_4_3 = ~z~And maybe... maybe this gang's too big for one man to get all dictational.

ODR_POLIB1_5_1 = ~z~We ain't no O'Driscoll boys, fellers. We men.

ODR_POLIB1_5_2 = ~z~Ah, shut up.

ODR_POLIB1_5_3 = ~z~

ODR_POLIB1_7_1 = ~z~Colm's got a hold on you boys, I ain't never gonna understand.

ODR_POLIB1_7_2 = ~z~The clue's in the name, fool. Colm O'Driscoll. We O'Driscoll boys.

ODR_POLIB1_9_1 = ~z~Let me get this right. All this expostulating... is just so you can get your prick teased more regular? Huh?

ODR_POLIB1_9_2 = ~z~Why, you're dumber than I thought.

ODR_POLIB1_10_1 = ~z~Hey, one man's dumb is another man's free thinker.

ODR_POLIB1_10_2 = ~z~Or so I been told.

ODR_POLIB2_0_1 = ~z~Look, I get it. Orders is orders.

ODR_POLIB2_0_2 = ~z~But what's an order to an orderer, if the orderer a-ain't sure that order being followed? You get me?

ODR_POLIB2_1_1 = ~z~Like, if a bear falls in the woods, there ain't no one to see. Or-or like...

ODR_POLIB2_1_2 = ~z~If there's some fellers in the woods, a-and they've been drinking and they come across some ladies...

ODR_POLIB2_1_3 = ~z~there ain't no one there to see, or-or not hear nothing...

ODR_POLIB2_2_1 = ~z~Well, shit, it didn't happen, you see?

ODR_POLIB2_2_2 = ~z~I see you better shut your trap.

ODR_POLIB2_2_3 = ~z~

ODR_POLIB2_4_1 = ~z~Well, I see you fellers just don't wanna think philosophical on the subject.

ODR_POLIB2_4_2 = ~z~You ain't thinking philosophical. You thinking with your pecker.

ODR_POLIB2_6_1 = ~z~And besides. We'd be there to see the goings on. And so would the strumpets.

ODR_POLIB2_6_2 = ~z~So it would happen, even by your horn-dog reasoning.

ODR_POLIB2_7_1 = ~z~Least I'm reasoning, not just sitting there bored out my skull.

ODR_RACLEAR_01 = ~z~O'Driscolls, was you?

ODR_RACLEAR_02 = ~z~That all of you? Shit.
