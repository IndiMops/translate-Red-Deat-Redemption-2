GH23CHJHNBNT0_1 = ~z~~sl:0.8~My bag's on the dockside.

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_1 = ~z~So... what happened?

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~You mean?~sl:1.4:4.4~Arthur and me, we were together... I had to get out, but...~sl:0.7~he went back... for the money...

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_3 = ~z~You... you know that Arthur...

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Sure. Word got to me up North,~sl:~so I went back and buried him and Miss Grimshaw.

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_5 = ~z~I had to run... if any of us had been found we'd have...

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_6 = ~z~Of course. I understand...

GH23CHJHNBNT1B_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~He's where he would have wanted to be...~sl:0.5~a pretty hillside... facing the evening sun.

GH23CHJHNBNT1C_1 = ~z~He gave me his satchel. With some of his things in it.

GH23CHJHNBNT1C_2 = ~z~Remember that journal he always drew in? I got it...

GH23CHJHNBNT1C_3 = ~z~I'm a bit of a draftsman myself nowadays.

GH23CHJHNBNT1_1 = ~z~So... what happened?

GH23CHJHNBNT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~You mean, back then? Arthur helped me get out...~sl:~gave me a chance to... live, I guess.

GH23CHJHNBNT1_3 = ~z~You-you know that, Arthur...

GH23CHJHNBNT1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Sure. Word got to me up North,~sl:~so I went back and buried him and Miss Grimshaw.

GH23CHJHNBNT1_5 = ~z~I had to run... if any of us had been found we'd have...

GH23CHJHNBNT1_6 = ~z~Of course. I understand...

GH23CHJHNBNT1_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~He's where he would have wanted to be...~sl:~a pretty hillside... facing the evening sun...

GH23CHJHNBNT2B_1 = ~z~~sl:1.4:3.8~He wasn't a good man... none of us were, but, uh...~sl:0.5~maybe he was true to himself...

GH23CHJHNBNT2B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Him and his code...~sl:1.0~that pigheaded bastard...

GH23CHJHNBNT2B_3 = ~z~~sl:.0.0:2.0~You get sick like that, I guess you...~sl:0.5~you gotta cling to something.

GH23CHJHNBNT2B_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~He was hoping to come out of it... hope was about all he had left...~sl:0.8~maybe all any of us have.

GH23CHJHNBNT2B_5 = ~z~

GH23CHJHNBNT2_1 = ~z~He was a good man... as much as any of us could be...

GH23CHJHNBNT2_2 = ~z~Getting sick like that has to rattle a feller.

GH23CHJHNBNT2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.4:4.1~Rattle him or... give him some kind of understanding...~sl:0.7~what his life was really all about.

GH23CHJHNBNT2_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~Yeah...~sl:1.9~that makes sense.

GH23CHJHNBNT3B_1 = ~z~They picked up Strauss. The agents. Made a real mess of him.

GH23CHJHNBNT3B_2 = ~z~I heard he died in custody, never said a word.

GH23CHJHNBNT3B_3 = ~z~~sl:0.8~I guess some folk is strong in ways you can't see.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_1 = ~z~Everything that happened... all those deaths... Micah?

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_2 = ~z~None of us is innocent in that... Dutch least of all...

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~but I don't think we would'a had to make those calls.~sl:~All that mayhem. If it wasn't for...

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_4 = ~z~We were on a very bad path...

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_5 = ~z~And Micah Bell dragged us into the abyss.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_6 = ~z~~sl:1.0:4.9~It never ends well... gangs like ours don't ride off into the sunset.~sl:0.8~Not these days.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_7 = ~z~Maybe Arthur's sunset's the best we can hope for.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_8 = ~z~I actually believed it, you know... once...

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~The original plan... that we'd have a ranch one day...~sl:~horses, cattle, big noisy dinners...

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_10 = ~z~~sl:0.6~all of us living free and honest.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~Funny you should say that.~sl:0.4~That's what I'm hoping for this place in the high country.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_12 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Only, it's just me and Uncle at the moment.~sl:0.3~And maybe Abigail and Jack if they'll take me back.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_13 = ~z~And the ranch is... well, wait 'til you see the ranch.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_14 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~I'll let you decide what you think.~sl:0.3~I think it's mighty fine. Or has the potential to be.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_15 = ~z~~sl:1.2~You're a lucky man, John. I always thought you might be.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_16 = ~z~I hope you'll stay with us.

GH23CHJHNBNT3C_17 = ~z~I will... for a while.

GH23CHJHNBNT3_1 = ~z~Anyway, I heard all of you were dead, or I might have come looking...

GH23CHJHNBNT3_2 = ~z~And me the same about you.

GH23CHJHNBNT3_3 = ~z~Dutch?

GH23CHJHNBNT3_4 = ~z~Who knows? Dead, maybe. I'm not sure...

GH23CHJHNBNT3_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~I heard all kind of things, but one thing I know,~sl:~he ain't around here...

GH23CHJHNBNT3_6 = ~z~I ain't heard nothing real in years, since... well... that time.

GH23CHJHNBNT3_7 = ~z~Nor me. Micah?

GH23CHJHNBNT3_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~I hope that bastard is dead.~sl:~You know he was the one speaking to them agents?

GH23CHJHNBNT3_9 = ~z~What?

GH23CHJHNBNT3_10 = ~z~Putting them on us the whole time... or since before I got off Sisika.

MAR6_CJINWAGON_6 = ~z~Good so far.

MAR6_CJINWAGON_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Further we get from those gunshots, better chance we have...~sl:0.4~of denying it, at least.

MAR6_CJINWAGON_8 = ~z~No. We can't get caught. Martelli has the Police Chief in his pocket.

MAR6_CJINWAGON_9 = ~z~If they take us in, we won't get out of the interview room.

MAR6_CJINWAGON_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~I don't wanna get in a shootout over this.~sl:0.2~That's not the man I try to be anymore.
