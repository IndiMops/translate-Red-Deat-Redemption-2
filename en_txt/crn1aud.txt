CRN1_IG2_STOP_11 = ~z~~sl:0.4:3.4~I hear he's rich enough to share the wealth around...~sl:0.2:1.8:1~and not miss it too much.

CRN1_IG2_STOP_12 = ~z~~sl:0.1:0.0~Oh, he'll miss it.

CRN1_IG2_STOP_13 = ~z~Okay, one of you check out round the back.

CRN1_IG3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6:1~Now, let's see what's inside.

CRN1_IG8_A_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~Place looks empty to me.~sl:0.9:2.1:1~Now, the old guy up there is full of crap.

CRN1_IG8_A_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4:1~Yeah, I don't think they're here. Don't see any horses.

CRN1_IG8_A_5 = ~z~Come on, let's head back.

CRN1_IG8_A_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~Boss.~sl:0.8:1.0:1~Place is empty.

CRN1_IG16_6 = ~z~Shh...

CRN1_IG16_FOLLW_1 = ~z~Follow my lead.

CRN1_INT_1 = ~z~Ah, call me Molly would ya?

CRN1_INT_2 = ~z~Arthur, how is Dutch?

CRN1_INT_3 = ~z~I mean, how does he seem to you?

CRN1_INT_4 = ~z~About the same as usual, I guess.

CRN1_INT_5 = ~z~I... I really love him you know...

CRN1_INT_13 = ~z~So, you got some tip off, so now...

CRN1_INT_14 = ~z~I can risk my neck, and make you some money...

CRN1_INT_15 = ~z~while you lounge around.

CRN1_INT_16 = ~z~You know, Arthur, bitterness, it works on the inside...

CRN1_INT_17 = ~z~as well as on your sour face.

CRN1_INT_18 = ~z~If you say so...

CRN1_INT_19 = ~z~but you can go find some other fool to run your errands.

CRN1_INT_20 = ~z~Bill, come on over here...

CRN1_INT_21 = ~z~will you be my other fool?

CRN1_INT_22 = ~z~You too, Charles.

CRN1_INT_29 = ~z~I got a serious medical condition.

CRN1_INT_30 = ~z~Yes, you are a compulsive liar.

CRN1_INT_31 = ~z~No need to be like that.

CRN1_INT_32 = ~z~Charles, have I ever lied to you?

CRN1_INT_33 = ~z~I hardly know you.

CRN1_INT_34 = ~z~Exactly.

CRN1_INT_35 = ~z~Now you boys should do this, it's easy...

CRN1_INT_36 = ~z~and I'll only take a small commission for my information...

CRN1_INT_41 = ~z~Well, what is it?

CRN1_INT_42 = ~z~It's a supply wagon carrying payroll...

CRN1_INT_43 = ~z~but very briefly unguarded apparently...

CRN1_INT_44 = ~z~as it passes through a crossroads near here...

CRN1_INT_45 = ~z~where there's an old ruined church...

CRN1_INT_46 = ~z~before it connects with the rest of the wagon train.

CRN1_INT_47 = ~z~Very easy pickings.

CRN1_INT_48 = ~z~As long as we get paid or, you get shot...
