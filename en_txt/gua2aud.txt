GUA2_EXT_14 = ~z~So, who is this Fussar?

GUA2_EXT_15 = ~z~A tyrant, driven by nothing but power and greed.

GUA2_EXT_16 = ~z~Our only purpose is to work ourselves to death...

GUA2_EXT_17 = ~z~to make him rich.

GUA2_EXT_18 = ~z~Leon wants the people to stand up to Fussar...

GUA2_EXT_31 = ~z~hoping to find a way back to their homes.

GUA2_EXT_32 = ~z~Now Fussar's men are out hunting them down.

GUA2_EXT_33 = ~z~That old fort, Cinco Torres...

GUA2_EXT_34 = ~z~my men and I use that as a hideout when we are here.

GUA2_EXT_35 = ~z~Come on...

GUA2_EXT_42 = ~z~Help Leon with that group of escaped workers...

GUA2_EXT_43 = ~z~and then come meet me at the fort.

GUA2_EXT_44 = ~z~You help us get back our friend...

GUA2_EXT_51 = ~z~There is a cave hidden below the cliffs.

GUA2_EXT_52 = ~z~It will lead you right there.

GUA2_EXT_53 = ~z~Thank you.

GUA2_EXT_54 = ~z~The workers are somewhere in the jungle.

GUA2_EXT_55 = ~z~Hopefully we can get to them before Fussar does.

GUA2_EXT_56 = ~z~Of course.

GUA2_EXT_57 = ~z~Gentlemen, goodbye.~n~~m~Well...

GUA2_EXT_58 = ~z~if this is a tropical paradise...

GUA2_EXT_59 = ~z~so far it ain't up to much.

GUA2_IG1_9 = ~z~Well, how very upsetting for you.

GUA2_IG1_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Not half as upsetting as it'll be for them.~lr:0.5~Mr. Fussar has a lot of very powerful friends.

GUA2_IG1_11 = ~z~I will bet that he does.

GUA2_IG1_12 = ~z~~sl:0.2:2.3~Bunch of Haitian pirates won't frighten him.~lr:0.6~They'll be strung up in the streets soon enough.
