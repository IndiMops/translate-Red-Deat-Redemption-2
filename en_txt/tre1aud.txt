TRE1_IG_INT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.5~I meant about what Trelawny said, about these bounty hunters?

TRE1_IG_INT_3 = ~z~Not sweating as such, but maybe a little gentle perspiration.

TRE1_IG_INT_4 = ~z~

TRE1_IG_INT_5 = ~z~Until we know more, ain't too much harm wasting good liquor on sweating.

TRE1_IG_INT_6 = ~z~So?

TRE1_IG_INT_7 = ~z~So, I think you should pay Mr. Trelawny a visit and find out exactly what he knows and who he spoke to.

TRE1_IG_INT_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Take Charles with you.~sl:~Oh, the sight of the pair of you would make a statue sing out its secrets.

TRE1_STAND_TRCK_01 = ~z~Should we keep moving?

TRE1_STAND_TRCK_02 = ~z~What is it, Arthur?

TRE1_STAND_TRCK_03 = ~z~Come on, we should keep on this trail.

TRE1_STAND_TRE_01 = ~z~Can we just get Trelawny and go?

TRE1_STAND_TRE_02 = ~z~Come on, let's not drag this out any longer.
