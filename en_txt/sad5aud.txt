SAD5_ILONEG2_1 = ~z~All that fuss, all that money... just so we could hang you.

SAD5_ILONEG2_2 = ~z~I don't get it either. And I didn't ask for any of this.

SAD5_ILONEG2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Way I heard it, there's plenty of folk that did.~sl:0.8~And they're gonna be real relieved when you swing.

SAD5_ILONEG3_1 = ~z~How long's it take to hang a man in Blackwater?

SAD5_ILONEG3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~I'm thinking we should have brought you in the other way.~sl:0.6~Not alive.

SAD5_ILONEG3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~It was the lady calling the shots,~sl:~I don't think you had much of a say in it.

SAD5_ILONEG3_4 = ~z~The lady would have killed you gladly friend. Believe me on that.

SAD5_ILOPOS1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.9:2.1~I just brought you in, okay?~sl:0.5~This... this situation ain't my fault. I didn't make you kill no children.

SAD5_ILOPOS1_2 = ~z~Did that woman take your balls, or you never had any to begin with?

SAD5_ILOPOS1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.6~Guess that'll teach me to try to be civil with you.

SAD5_ILOPOS2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~At least now you got some peace...~sl:0.6~and you ain't being fought over by bounty hunters.

SAD5_ILOPOS2_2 = ~z~Yeah, it's real peaceful. Peaceful like the grave.

SAD5_ILOPOS2_3 = ~z~I guess, being a killer, you'd know a thing or two about that.

SAD5_ILOPOS2_4 = ~z~As I'm sure you do too, partner.

SAD5_ILOPOS3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Hey, how's it feel, knowing all your bad deeds~sl:~have finally caught up with you?

SAD5_ILOPOS3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~I don't know...~sl:0.5~how's it feel knowing your woman boss has got the bigger balls?

SAD5_ILOPOS3_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~She caught you, friend. Twice.~sl:0.7~And... one of those times you was hiding in a dress.

SAD5_INT_6 = ~z~you got any work?

SAD5_INT_7 = ~z~Yeah.

SAD5_INT_8 = ~z~Why, there's always work.

SAD5_INT_9 = ~z~Whole country's getting robbed, robbing or stopping robbers.

SAD5_INT_10 = ~z~Well, seems like there ain't much else in this world except...

SAD5_INT_11 = ~z~bastards, victims of bastards and...

SAD5_INT_12 = ~z~the bastards who want to put the bastards in the ground.

SAD5_INT_13 = ~z~And which are you exactly?

SAD5_INT_14 = ~z~Me?

SAD5_INT_15 = ~z~In my time, all three, but...

SAD5_INT_16 = ~z~same as most people.

SAD5_INT_17 = ~z~I guess...

SAD5_INT_18 = ~z~Funny thing about this job, well...

SAD5_INT_19 = ~z~opportunity...

SAD5_INT_26 = ~z~I caught him last week.

SAD5_INT_27 = ~z~He was disguised as a lady in a house for fallen women.

SAD5_INT_28 = ~z~I was bringing him in, when I got robbed...

SAD5_INT_29 = ~z~by a professional rival of mine...

SAD5_INT_30 = ~z~James Langton.

SAD5_INT_31 = ~z~He's a nasty bastard.

SAD5_INT_32 = ~z~I didn't much like him even before he robbed me.

SAD5_INT_33 = ~z~That happen a lot...

SAD5_INT_34 = ~z~in this line of work?

SAD5_INT_35 = ~z~Yeah, but they're all people like me.

SAD5_INT_36 = ~z~Anyway, now they're holed up in the desert...

SAD5_INT_37 = ~z~down south waiting to head north so they can...

SAD5_INT_38 = ~z~hand him in to the state troopers in the North Country.

SAD5_INT_39 = ~z~I'd given up on the job as just a bad lot but...

SAD5_INT_40 = ~z~now that you're here...

SAD5_INT_41 = ~z~maybe we can go rob him back.

SAD5_INT_42 = ~z~Is the money good?

SAD5_INT_43 = ~z~Yeah. It's real good.

SAD5_INT_44 = ~z~Plus, I don't much like getting robbed...

SAD5_INT_45 = ~z~by no one.

SAD5_INT_46 = ~z~Come on.

SAD5_INT_47 = ~z~Where is it we're heading again you say?

SAD5_INT_LI_1 = ~z~Hello, Sadie.

SAD5_INT_LI_2 = ~z~Oh, John... come, sit down.

SAD5_JRETURN_03 = ~z~You're more of a killer than me.

SAD5_JRETURN_04 = ~z~That bastard that put me in here.

SAD5_JRETURN_05 = ~z~Hey, how's that harpy?

SAD5_JRETURN_06 = ~z~Damn you, mister.

SAD5_MOUNT_01 = ~z~Come on, let's go.

SAD5_MOUNT_02 = ~z~Come on, mount up.

SAD5_MOUNT_03 = ~z~Get on your horse, John.

SAD5_NEWHORSE_1 = ~z~That a new horse?

SAD5_NEWHORSE_2 = ~z~Some folk buy ranches, some buy horses. Horses are cheaper.

SAD5_NEWHORSE_3 = ~z~He looks mean.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_2 = ~z~Yeah. ~rp~He's doing... okay. ~rp~He was prize-fighting in Saint Denis.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_3 = ~z~Weren't seeming too well... ~rp~he took everything real hard... but ~rp~I think life on the plains is going to be good for him.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_4 = ~z~I always liked Charles. ~rp~You send him my best.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_5 = ~z~I will. ~rp~You know you could come along too? ~rp~Build a cabin on the land.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_6 = ~z~I done all that before. Can't do it again.~rp~ I'm on my own now, John.~rp~ I ain't so good with people.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_7 = ~z~The offer is there, whenever you want it.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_8 = ~z~That's kind. Unlikely to be taken up, but kind.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_9 = ~z~You heard anything of Dutch?

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_10 = ~z~Nothing. You?

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_11 = ~z~Nah. ~rp~You'd think... he's a colorful character... ~rp~word would get out.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_12 = ~z~That's one way of putting it. Look, ~rp~what happened with the gang... changed everyone who was part of it...

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_13 = ~z~the Dutch who put a blanket 'round me after the O'Driscolls... ~rp~that weren't the same man at Beaver Hollow.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_14 = ~z~And now, ~rp~he might not be so colorful no more.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_15 = ~z~You see a man whose character changed. ~rp~I see a man who got found out... for who he truly was.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_16 = ~z~We was fools to follow him.~rp~ I was a fool and I paid for it, and I was one of the lucky ones.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_17 = ~z~Micah, John. Micah's the one who set it off.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_18 = ~z~I blame me for following Dutch for too long. But I blame Micah for most everything else.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_19 = ~z~He's out there.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_20 = ~z~And some day, I hope we'll find him. But not now.

SAD5_RBNT_CONT_21 = ~z~Come on.

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_1 = ~z~So, ~rp~I actually did buy that ranch...

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_2 = ~z~Hey, good for you.

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_3 = ~z~The money... ~rp~that you're holding onto for me... ~rp~from Nathan Kirk's bounty...

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_4 = ~z~can you give it to the West Elizabeth Co-Operative Bank on my behalf?

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_5 = ~z~Of course.

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_6 = ~z~I owe them a bunch of money.

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_7 = ~z~Then you better do a bunch of work.

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_8 = ~z~Yeah. I sure should. ~rp~Maybe not this kind, though.

SAD5_RBNT_NBCH_9 = ~z~Oh come on. This'll be fun.

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_1 = ~z~Guess who I got up there with me?

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_2 = ~z~Abigail?

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_3 = ~z~Abigail ain't come there just yet.

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_4 = ~z~You want to talk about it?

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_5 = ~z~Well, maybe but ~rp~Uncle... ~rp~I bumped into Uncle.

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_6 = ~z~Whoever traded you Abigail for Uncle got themselves the deal of this new century.

SAD5_RBNT_NUNC_7 = ~z~And Charles Smith too.

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_1 = ~z~My ranch, it's something else, you know. ~rp~You got to come up there.

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_2 = ~z~Ain't had any trouble?

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_3 = ~z~Some squatters, but ~rp~that's it for the most part.

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_4 = ~z~That's good. ~rp~Maybe these fellers I heard about have stayed North, or gone off somewhere else.

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_5 = ~z~Or dropped down dead in their tracks.

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_6 = ~z~It's good country.

SAD5_RBNT_YBCH_7 = ~z~All country is good. ~rp~It's just folk that's bad.

SAD5_RBNT_YUNC_1 = ~z~You know who I got up there with me?

SAD5_RBNT_YUNC_4 = ~z~Abigail?

SAD5_RBNT_YUNC_5 = ~z~Abigail ain't come there just yet.

SAD5_RBNT_YUNC_6 = ~z~Really? You, err, ~rp~want to talk about it?

SAD5_RIDEBANTSHOUTED_10 = ~z~We'll see. Maybe.

SAD5_RIDEBANTSPOKEN_10 = ~z~Yeah, we'll see. Maybe.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_1 = ~z~Bounty work ain't easy, John.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_2 = ~z~No. But I can see now that it has its rewards.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_3 = ~z~It's a whole lot easier with a partner.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_4 = ~z~That, back there, ~rp~you didn't need a partner, ~rp~you needed a whole company behind you.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_5 = ~z~We did fine, and, with Langton and his men gone, ~rp~they'll be more demand for our service.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_6 = ~z~Sadie. ~rp~You know I'm a rancher now... mostly.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_7 = ~z~And I know how you're paying for your ranch.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_8 = ~z~Don't spread that around.

SAD5_RIDEBANT_9 = ~z~Hey, I won't. But it would be good to have you along some more.

SAD5_S1_CUTOFF_1 = ~z~We cut off here.

SAD5_S1_OBJ1_1 = ~z~South.

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_2 = ~z~Yes, ma'am.

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_A_1 = ~z~You don't know how it felt. ~rp~Getting robbed like that.

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_A_2 = ~z~ And having to let it happen. ~rp~I'm angry even thinking about it!

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_A_3 = ~z~If you'd done something, they would have shot you to pieces.

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_A_4 = ~z~I might have got a few of them.

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_A_5 = ~z~You didn't have any choice.

SAD5_S1_OBJ2_A_6 = ~z~That don't mean I have to like it.

SAD5_S2_OBJ3_4 = ~z~And we aim to have Langton give him back to us?

SAD5_S2_OBJ3_5 = ~z~Before he rides north with him to hand him over to some state troopers?

SAD5_S2_OBJ3_6 = ~z~Correct again. ~rp~Though the giving back part is optimistic.
