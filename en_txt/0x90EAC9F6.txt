LBWIN_AIMGUN_01 = ~z~You wouldn't hurt me, now would you?

LBWIN_AIMGUN_02 = ~z~You don't need to use that!

LBWIN_AIMGUN_03 = ~z~There's no call for that at all!

LBWIN_AIMLASSO_01 = ~z~Now, steady on.

LBWIN_AIMLASSO_02 = ~z~I thought I'd earned your trust.

LBWIN_AIMLASSO_03 = ~z~I've been quite cooperative!

LBWIN_AMBUSH_01 = ~z~They must have followed us!

LBWIN_AMBUSH_02 = ~z~Help!

LBWIN_AMBUSH_03 = ~z~They're coming for me!

LBWIN_ATTACK1_01 = ~z~Oh dear! Here they are!

LBWIN_ATTACK1_02 = ~z~They must have been waiting for us!

LBWIN_ATTACK1_03 = ~z~Protect me, if you want the deeds!

LBWIN_ATTACK2_01 = ~z~My tormentors!

LBWIN_ATTACK2_02 = ~z~They're out for blood.

LBWIN_BBANT1_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~This better not be them.~sl:1.1~It's not them... thank the Lord.

LBWIN_BBANT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Try and hold it together.~sl:~Fortitude, man. Show some mettle.

LBWIN_BBANT1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Why I thought I'd be cut out for the life of a vagabond,~sl:~I'll never know.

LBWIN_BBANT1_4 = ~z~Look at me, hiding like a school boy.

LBWIN_BBANT2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Very good. You can take me in now.~sl:0.0:1.8~Time to face the music.~sl:~But may I ask you, please, don't tie me up?

LBWIN_BBANT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Let me keep the little dignity I have remaining.~sl:~I have been kind and honest to you all.

LBWIN_BBANT3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~This is most unbecoming.~rp~ I'm a man of stature,~sl:~a natural leader, always have been.

LBWIN_BBANT3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~To think I would fall so low.~rp~ Ask anyone.~sl:~Tobin Winfield: prep school hero, the talk of New Haven.

LBWIN_BBANT3_3 = ~z~Such promise, gifted in so many ways.~rp~ And now a common thief.

LBWIN_BBANT3_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~I could have done anything. That was my problem, you see.~sl:~Too many avenues were open to me.

LBWIN_BBANT3_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Things came so easily that I took it all for granted.~rp~~sl:~Can you understand?

LBWIN_BBANT3_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~It's an insidious curse to be charming, intelligent~sl:~and born into money.

LBWIN_BBANT3_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~A life of public service is not for everyone,~sl:~and indeed it should not have been for me.

LBWIN_BBANT3_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~No, I should have stayed in the law, or gone into cotton.~rp~~sl:~Yes, as a politician, I helped people... oh, did I help people.

LBWIN_BBANT3_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~I was good for business and kind enough to the unfortunates...~rp~~sl:~but I was not kind enough to myself.

LBWIN_BBANT3_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~We all make mistakes...~sl:~and mine was not thinking enough of myself.

LBWIN_BBANT3_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~That is why I purloined those funds...~rp~~sl:1.3~I'm sure a judge will understand.

LBWIN_BEG_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~They won't put me in jail, will they?~sl:~Not a man of my social standing... I won't last!

LBWIN_BEG_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I have breathed the filthy air of the criminal sphere,~sl:~and I don't wish to again. Please, I'll never survive!

LBWIN_BINK_INT_1 = ~z~Now this gentleman...

LBWIN_BINK_INT_2 = ~z~Mr. Tobin Winfield the third...

LBWIN_BINK_INT_3 = ~z~he's more used to signing off on bounties...

LBWIN_BINK_INT_4 = ~z~than being the subject of them.

LBWIN_BINK_INT_5 = ~z~But no one cries when a corrupt politician gets their comeuppance.

LBWIN_BINK_INT_6 = ~z~I believe he's hiding out in Thieves Landing.

LBWIN_BINK_INT_7 = ~z~Yeah, the man's a thief...

LBWIN_BINK_INT_8 = ~z~but not the same kind as the rest of 'em down there.

LBWIN_BINK_INT_9 = ~z~I'd wager he won't survive the week.

LBWIN_BINK_INT_10 = ~z~From the looks of this poster...

LBWIN_BINK_INT_11 = ~z~you're to recover the deeds that he stole.

LBWIN_BINK_INT_12 = ~z~So make sure you find them.

LBWIN_BTYFOLLOW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I can go in on my own terms, can I? Very good.~sl:0.0:2.0~I can't tell you what it means to be~sl:~treated with some decency... finally.

LBWIN_BTYFOLLOW_2 = ~z~You lead the way. I will follow obediently.

LBWIN_BTYSHOUT_01 = ~z~Oh no, not more of them!

LBWIN_BTYSHOUT_02 = ~z~Don't touch me!

LBWIN_BTYSHOUT_03 = ~z~Somebody please protect me!

LBWIN_BTYSHOUT_04 = ~z~Don't let them touch me!

LBWIN_CARRYALVE_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~There are more pressing matters at hand,~sl:~like those gentlemen with guns!

LBWIN_CARRYALVE_02 = ~z~Put me down, I'll be caught in the crossfire!

LBWIN_CARRYDEAD_01 = ~z~Really, I can walk. Put me down!

LBWIN_CARRYDEAD_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Out of the hands of one brute,~sl:~and into the hands of another.

LBWIN_CLOSER1_1 = ~z~Come on, we have some distance to go yet.

LBWIN_CLOSER2_1 = ~z~Not too much further now.

LBWIN_CLOSER3_1 = ~z~Ah, they're sequestered just up ahead.

LBWIN_CLOSER4_1 = ~z~Well here we are.

LBWIN_COMBAT1A_01 = ~z~Hey, we saw him first!

LBWIN_COMBAT1A_02 = ~z~The mayor belongs to us!

LBWIN_COMBAT1A_03 = ~z~You give him back, he's ours!

LBWIN_COMBAT2A_01 = ~z~There they are, they're with Tobin!

LBWIN_COMBAT2A_02 = ~z~Take them out!

LBWIN_COMBAT2A_03 = ~z~I knew he had more stashed away.

LBWIN_COMBAT2A_04 = ~z~You holding out on us, Tobin?

LBWIN_DEALT_1 = ~z~I'm afraid that was only a small contingent of them.

LBWIN_DEALT_2 = ~z~No time to lose. Shall we hurry on and get the deeds?

LBWIN_DEEDS4_1 = ~z~The deeds are just under that rock.

LBWIN_DEEDS4_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~I'm a man of my word, don't you see?~sl:0.0:1.5~A man of integrity.~sl:~I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

LBWIN_ENAMBUSH_01 = ~z~C'mon, get 'em boys!

LBWIN_ENAMBUSH_02 = ~z~You running out on us, Tobin?

LBWIN_ENAMBUSH_03 = ~z~Hey, Tobin, I thought you was our new pet?

LBWIN_ENAMBUSH_04 = ~z~That rich little piggy's ours!

LBWIN_ESCAPE_1 = ~z~I hope you'll all get along.

LBWIN_ESCAPE_2 = ~z~I'll take my chances on my own!

LBWIN_FOLLOW_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~Very good, the deeds are a short ride away, sequestered.~sl:~Follow me and I will take you to them.

LBWIN_FOLLOW_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~There'll be no shenanigans on this trip,~sl:0.0:1.8~I can promise you that.~sl:~I give you the deeds, you save my life.

LBWIN_FOLLOW_3 = ~z~It's an excellent bargain for all parties involved.

LBWIN_HIT_01 = ~z~There's no need for that.

LBWIN_HIT_02 = ~z~Most uncalled for!

LBWIN_HIT_03 = ~z~Steady on!

LBWIN_HIT_04 = ~z~Really now.

LBWIN_HOGTIED1_01 = ~z~Tie me if you must, but really it is unnecessary.

LBWIN_HOGTIED1_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~I thought you would have treated me a little better,~sl:~considering the circumstances.

LBWIN_HOGTIED1_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Please, I don't deserve to be dragged around in the dirt!~sl:~It's unseemly.

LBWIN_HOGTIED2_01 = ~z~I was going for help!

LBWIN_HOGTIED2_02 = ~z~Please don't tie me up.

LBWIN_HOGTIED2_03 = ~z~Unhand me, you wretch!

LBWIN_HURRY1_01 = ~z~What are you doing? Don't you want the deeds?

LBWIN_HURRY1_02 = ~z~Well come on, keep up.

LBWIN_HURRY1_03 = ~z~Stay close to me. The cutthroats could be anywhere.

LBWIN_HURRY1_04 = ~z~Stay with me, won't you? I'd rather not be left alone.

LBWIN_HURRY2_01 = ~z~Well? What are you waiting for?

LBWIN_HURRY2_02 = ~z~Take them and let's go.

LBWIN_IDLE_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Maybe the judge will be friendly.~sl:~I've dined with most of them.

LBWIN_IDLE_02 = ~z~Shall we see if they'll take mercy on this poor wretch?

LBWIN_MCS1_1 = ~z~I'm here...

LBWIN_MCS1_2 = ~z~I'm here.

LBWIN_MCS1_3 = ~z~You got me.

LBWIN_MCS1_4 = ~z~I come willingly, but...

LBWIN_MCS1_5 = ~z~please hear me out.

LBWIN_MCS1_6 = ~z~I'm in danger.

LBWIN_MCS1_7 = ~z~Not... from you fine people.

LBWIN_MCS1_8 = ~z~Rather some cutthroats I was...

LBWIN_MCS1_9 = ~z~quite unwise to trust.

LBWIN_MCS1_10 = ~z~I promised them the deeds that I, uh...

LBWIN_MCS1_11 = ~z~misappropriated.

LBWIN_MCS1_12 = ~z~If they would help me flee.

LBWIN_MCS1_13 = ~z~Now, I have it on good authority that they mean to kill me...

LBWIN_MCS1_14 = ~z~for those deeds.

LBWIN_MCS1_15 = ~z~Protect me, and they're yours. I'll give it all back.

LBWIN_MCS1_16 = ~z~Yes?

LBWIN_MCS1_17 = ~z~Good, good.

LBWIN_MCS1_18 = ~z~Follow me.

LBWIN_MCS1_19 = ~z~They will be here very soon.

LBWIN_REASSURE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~The torment I've suffered you wouldn't believe.~rp~~sl:~My nerves are almost wrecked.

LBWIN_REASSURE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~It will take weeks in a sanitorium just to steady my hands.~rp~~sl:0.4~The slightest bang and I jump out of my britches.

LBWIN_REASSURE_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Really. The time I've had.~rp~ I thought these men...~sl:~these cutthroats... were my friends...

LBWIN_REASSURE_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~or at least I thought they were reliable lackeys...~rp~~sl:~but control them I could not.

LBWIN_REASSURE_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5~They were the picture of concern and care until I was isolated,~sl:~and then...~rp~ I shudder to remember.

LBWIN_REASSURE_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~They started spending my money, taking my things,~sl:0.0:1.9~abusing my person...~sl:~they took real pleasure in my distress.

LBWIN_REASSURE_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~It was only a matter of time before they got bored,~sl:~exhausted my funds, and decided to consign me to oblivion.

LBWIN_REASSURE_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I'm so damned grateful you came along when you did.~rp~~sl:~A strange twist of fate indeed, but this bounty may have saved my life.
