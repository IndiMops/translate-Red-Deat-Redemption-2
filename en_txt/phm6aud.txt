PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_6 = ~z~Pappy was boiling when he sees her, don't you?

PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_7 = ~z~Ooh what the hickory's her names now?

PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_8 = ~z~Digs her up and ask, don't you?

PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_9 = ~z~Next run to market I combs my hairs all flowy like, I says to the girl "Good morning" and you watch now.

PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_11 = ~z~Newt and Edie takes the wagon now, don't you!

PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_12 = ~z~Now shut your gulpers and do it right on that ginseng!

PRHM6_IG5_ARGUE_14 = ~z~We's surely stuck here like hog pins now.

PRHM6_IG6_CONV_1 = ~z~We gots all we envys right here.

PRHM6_IG6_CONV_2 = ~z~I don't wants no different.

PRHM6_IG6_CONV_3 = ~z~But you, me, Mal, Finney, we's full growed now.

PRHM6_IG6_CONV_4 = ~z~The outlanders'll blandish you, surely they will.

PRHM6_IG6_CONV_10 = ~z~Okay, Edie.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_1 = ~z~I needs you to be the tall man here, Finney, now don't you?

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_2 = ~z~Mal and Newt, they sees you veering squirly, they veer squirly likewise.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_3 = ~z~When they fails me, you fails me.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_4 = ~z~Don't bend to the blandishing 'cause there's nothing but damnation out there.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_5 = ~z~We sells to 'em, don't you?

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_6 = ~z~But we keeps apart like we always keeps. The outland's in the shadows, like I says it is.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_7 = ~z~We're free and freer still surely in the world to come.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_8 = ~z~So no more of this dippy yakketing, you hears?

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_9 = ~z~I hears.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_10 = ~z~Go on with you now. Sleep deep.

PRHM6_IG7_CONV_11 = ~z~Sleep deep, Papa.

PRHM6_INT_1 = ~z~I heard about a house...

PRHM6_INT_3 = ~z~What kind of a house?

PRHM6_INT_4 = ~z~I don't know...

PRHM6_INT_5 = ~z~couple of fellers I heard in town they said...

PRHM6_INT_6 = ~z~said it was really freakish.

PRHM6_INT_7 = ~z~Family local bogeymen, I guess...

PRHM6_INT_8 = ~z~but they're crooked in every way.

PRHM6_INT_9 = ~z~So?

PRHM6_INT_10 = ~z~So, these boys thought they was sitting on a lot of cash...

PRHM6_INT_11 = ~z~they're highway robbers, kidnappers, apparently.

PRHM6_INT_12 = ~z~They're well hidden in the woods.

PRHM6_INT_13 = ~z~Sounds pretty dubious.

PRHM6_INT_14 = ~z~Of course, it's dubious, but...

PRHM6_INT_15 = ~z~there ain't much risk of getting caught.

PRHM6_INT_16 = ~z~Okay then...

PRHM6_INT_17 = ~z~let's go take a look.

PRHM6_INT_18 = ~z~Exactly...

PRHM6_INT_19 = ~z~just take a look.

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_1 = ~z~Now square's not what this is!

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_2 = ~z~Square don't put gristle in your gizzard like Pappy tells you.

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_3 = ~z~Mal's right, no more yakketing.

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_4 = ~z~But why's me every time hunting the swinkin' pig?

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_5 = ~z~Cause you's callow as a pup, don't you?

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_6 = ~z~Callow? You's guggling the girls at the market, no work to pride on!

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_7 = ~z~Shut your gulper, Newt, don't you!

PRHM6_PREARGUE1_8 = ~z~Pappy hears and I'll be munching doodle from the horses.

PRHM6_SCOUTBANT_3 = ~z~You just keep selling me on this job, don't you?

PRHM6_TOHORSES_1 = ~z~It's up north, on the other side of the river from Valentine.

PRHM6_TOHORSES_2 = ~z~Best way there is through Cumberland Falls, though. You know it?

PRHM6_TOHORSES_3 = ~z~Sure, more or less.

PRHM6_TOOFAST_1_1 = ~z~Arthur, wait up. Don't just go running in there.

PRHM6_TOOFAST_2_1 = ~z~Just take it slow, we need to know what we're dealing with.

PRHM6_TOOFAST_3_1 = ~z~Goddamn it. Wait, Arthur. What has gotten into you?
