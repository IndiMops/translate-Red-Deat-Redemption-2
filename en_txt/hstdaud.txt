HMSTD_1_NEG_ILO_1 = ~z~I'd give up now if I was you. This is going nowhere.

HMSTD_1_NEG_ILO_2 = ~z~Hey, we're just getting started. My sons may be idiots but it'll hold up.

HMSTD_1_POS_ILO_1 = ~z~Well good luck to you.

HMSTD_1_POS_ILO_2 = ~z~I just hope those two boneheads get their act together.

HMSTD_4_NEG_ILO_1 = ~z~Next time maybe take your sons fishing or something.

HMSTD_4_NEG_ILO_2 = ~z~You might be right... though they'd probably fall in and drown. Goddamn fools.

HMSTD_4_POS_ILO_1 = ~z~Good luck.

HMSTD_4_POS_ILO_2 = ~z~Same to you.

HMSTD_ASK_2_1 = ~z~Oh, you're back!

HMSTD_ASK_GUP_1 = ~z~I guess that's a no, then...

HMSTD_ASK_QUIT_1 = ~z~Listen, sorry, I just don't have time to help you with this lumber.

HMSTD_ASK_QUIT_2 = ~z~No, come on. Please. I'm at my wit's end here.

HMSTD_ASK_QUIT_3 = ~z~I got enough on my own plate. I'm sure you three can work it out.

HMSTD_ASK_RESN_1 = ~z~No, not yet.

HMSTD_ASK_RESN_2 = ~z~Well, I appreciate you trying. If we don't get our hands on some soon, I reckon we'll just have to call it quits.

HMSTD_ASK_RESP_1 = ~z~No lumber, but I guess I can lend you some money.

HMSTD_ASK_WAG_1 = ~z~We're about ready to call it quits, to be honest with you.

HMSTD_ASK_WAG_2 = ~z~Listen, I-I... I hate to ask , but...

HMSTD_ASK_WAG_3 = ~z~do you think we could have the lumber on that wagon there?

HMSTD_ASK_WAG_4 = ~z~I-I-I will pay you back, I swear on my life.

HMSTD_BODY_01 = ~z~Whoa, I sure hope you got a good reason to be carrying that around.

HMSTD_BUMP_1 = ~z~What the hell is your problem? You could've killed someone!

HMSTD_BUMP_N_1 = ~z~Stay outta my way, then.

HMSTD_BUMP_N_2 = ~z~Why don't you leave us alone?

HMSTD_IG1DAD2_5 = ~z~No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Get away from it.

HMSTD_IG1DAD2_6 = ~z~Get away from it before you mess it up even worse than it is.

HMSTD_IG1DADB_1 = ~z~All the best.

HMSTD_IG1DADB_2 = ~z~You too, friend.

HMSTD_IG1DAD_1 = ~z~Thought I'd teach them a few things, you know?

HMSTD_IG1DAD_2 = ~z~Couldn't hammer a nail to save their lives.

HMSTD_IG1DAD_3 = ~z~Ain't that right, Curtis?

HMSTD_IG1DAD_4 = ~z~Whatever you say, Pa.

HMSTD_IG1DAD_5 = ~z~

HMSTD_IG1DAD_6 = ~z~Well, good luck to you.

HMSTD_IG2NJA2_1 = ~z~Oh, I asked God for sons and he sent me donkeys.

HMSTD_IG2NJA2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2:1~Ain't that right, boys?

HMSTD_IG2NJA2_3 = ~z~

HMSTD_IG2NJA_1 = ~z~Oh, hello again. Good to see you again.

HMSTD_IG2NJA_2 = ~z~Ah, we're moving along slowly, but less than surely.

HMSTD_IG2NJA_3 = ~z~I got more of a chance of teaching a pig to sing opera,

HMSTD_IG2NJA_4 = ~z~than to turn this pair into carpenters.

HMSTD_IG2NJ_1 = ~z~Ah, good to see you again.

HMSTD_IG2NJ_2 = ~z~We're moving along here slow as ever, as you can see.

HMSTD_IG2NJ_3 = ~z~Kinda like rolling molasses up a steep sandy hill, with these two.

HMSTD_IG3_ASKM_1 = ~z~We're about ready to call it quits, to be honest with you.

HMSTD_IG3_ASKM_2 = ~z~Listen, I-I... I hate to ask, but uh...

HMSTD_IG3_ASK_1 = ~z~Oh, hey there.

HMSTD_IG3_ASK_2 = ~z~How's it going?

HMSTD_IG3_ASK_3 = ~z~Well, it ain't going at all.

HMSTD_IG3_ASK_4 = ~z~We're broke.

HMSTD_IG3_NEAR_1 = ~z~Well, will you help us?

HMSTD_IG3_NEG_1 = ~z~You'll have to figure this out yourselves, it ain't my problem.

HMSTD_IG3_NEG_2 = ~z~I never said it was. No harm in asking.

HMSTD_IG3_NEG_3 = ~z~I'm clutching at anything right now.

HMSTD_IG3_PMON_1 = ~z~Alright, here you go. But you best not be playing me for a fool.

HMSTD_IG3_PMON_2 = ~z~Oh, I ain't mister. I swear.

HMSTD_IG3_PWOOD_1 = ~z~Well... I ain't promising nothing, but I'll see what I can do.

HMSTD_IG3_PWOOD_2 = ~z~There's a logging camp over in Big Valley, pretty much straight west of here, that

HMSTD_IG3_PWOOD_3 = ~z~might have lumber for sale.

HMSTD_IG3_WALKS_1 = ~z~Ah, never mind.

HMSTD_IG3_WALKS_2 = ~z~We'll figure something out, I guess.

HMSTD_LOITER_01 = ~z~Well don't let me keep you.

HMSTD_MIN_AGG_04 = ~z~Now get the hell out of here!

HMSTD_MIN_ATK_01 = ~z~Hey what are you doing?

HMSTD_MIN_ATK_02 = ~z~Just back off!

HMSTD_RESPA_1 = ~z~They don't look so bad to me.

HMSTD_RESP_1 = ~z~If you're gonna do it, do it right.

HMSTD_S1_AGGR1_1 = ~z~Alright, that's it. You've gone too far!

HMSTD_S1_AGGR2_1 = ~z~Get the hell off our property!

HMSTD_S1_AGGR3_1 = ~z~I ain't gonna tell you again!

HMSTD_S1_AGGR4_1 = ~z~Now get the hell out of here!

HMSTD_S1_AIM1_1 = ~z~Hey, watch where you're pointing that thing.

HMSTD_S1_AIM2_1 = ~z~You best put that away, before you hurt somebody.

HMSTD_S1_AMB1_01 = ~z~I hate this, it's so stupid.

HMSTD_S1_AMB1_02 = ~z~He just wants to lord over us.

HMSTD_S1_AMB1_03 = ~z~We should never have said yes to this.

HMSTD_S1_AMB2_01 = ~z~Shit, I didn't think they were serious.

HMSTD_S1_AMB2_02 = ~z~We're lucky to be alive.

HMSTD_S1_AMB2_03 = ~z~Wish Pa'd teach us to shoot instead building this stupid house.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3A_01 = ~z~We run out of money and he still won't give up.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3A_02 = ~z~Maybe he'll see reason now.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3A_03 = ~z~I swear he's crazy.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3B_01 = ~z~Soon as we're finished, I'm striking out on my own.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3B_02 = ~z~We're almost done, right?

HMSTD_S1_AMB3B_03 = ~z~Just a few more nails.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3C_01 = ~z~Seriously? Who gives away that much?

HMSTD_S1_AMB3C_02 = ~z~Dammit, I was really hoping to get out of this.

HMSTD_S1_AMB3C_03 = ~z~Guess we just have to hurry up and finish.

HMSTD_S1_ATKM1_1 = ~z~Hey enough of that.

HMSTD_S1_ATKM2_1 = ~z~Just back off.

HMSTD_S1_ATKM3_1 = ~z~Hey, watch it.

HMSTD_S1_ATKM4_1 = ~z~Are you crazy?

HMSTD_S1_BODY1_1 = ~z~I sure hope you got a good reason for carrying them around.

HMSTD_S1_BODY2_1 = ~z~I think it's best you keep moving along.

HMSTD_S1_CBT1_1 = ~z~Holy shit, just calm down.

HMSTD_S1_CBT2_1 = ~z~Leave me outta this.

HMSTD_S1_DIR_1 = ~z~Not that I care too much, but I think my father might want your help.

HMSTD_S1_DYN1_1 = ~z~Whoa, what are you doing with that dynamite?

HMSTD_S1_DYN2_1 = ~z~You're gonna kill somebody, you're not careful.

HMSTD_S1_HTF1_1 = ~z~What the hell are you doing to her?

HMSTD_S1_HTM1_1 = ~z~What the hell are you doing to him?

HMSTD_S1_NEG1_1 = ~z~You don't have the first idea what you're doing here, do you?

HMSTD_S1_NEG1_2 = ~z~Hey, you're preaching to the choir, mister.

HMSTD_S1_NEG2_1 = ~z~I don't know what you fools are playing at here.

HMSTD_S1_NEG2_2 = ~z~It's like being in a chain gang, but your pa's the prison warden.

HMSTD_S1_NEG3A_1 = ~z~You seriously think you're going to make any money off this place?

HMSTD_S1_NEG3A_2 = ~z~You're right, who's gonna buy this hunk of junk?

HMSTD_S1_NEG3B_1 = ~z~You can't think this shithole is worth anything?

HMSTD_S1_NEG3B_2 = ~z~I don't care if we just give it away at this point.

HMSTD_S1_POS1_1 = ~z~Keep at it, you'll get there.

HMSTD_S1_POS1_2 = ~z~I'd seriously rather be doing anything else.

HMSTD_S1_POS2_1 = ~z~You'll be alright.

HMSTD_S1_POS2_2 = ~z~If only I could turn back time and say no to this.

HMSTD_S1_POS3A_1 = ~z~The place is looking good.

HMSTD_S1_POS3A_2 = ~z~We're done if we don't get more money.

HMSTD_S1_POS3B_1 = ~z~Looks like you're almost there.

HMSTD_S1_POS3B_2 = ~z~We might actually finish this thing.

HMSTD_S1_STEAL1_1 = ~z~Hey, that ain't yours.

HMSTD_S1_STEAL2_1 = ~z~Don't you do that again.

HMSTD_S1_STEAL3_1 = ~z~Again? Are you serious?

HMSTD_S1_STEAL4_1 = ~z~Thieving bastard!

HMSTD_S2_AGGR1_1 = ~z~Alright, I've had enough of this.

HMSTD_S2_AGGR2_1 = ~z~You need to get off our land right now.

HMSTD_S2_AGGR3_1 = ~z~Are you listening to me?

HMSTD_S2_AGGR4_1 = ~z~Get the hell out of here.

HMSTD_S2_AIM1_1 = ~z~Hey, put that down.

HMSTD_S2_AIM2_1 = ~z~Come on, mister, don't do nothing stupid.

HMSTD_S2_AMB1_01 = ~z~I can't believe he's making us build a house.

HMSTD_S2_AMB1_02 = ~z~He's barely even picked up a hammer.

HMSTD_S2_AMB1_03 = ~z~Making us do all the work...

HMSTD_S2_AMB2_01 = ~z~They tried to kill us.

HMSTD_S2_AMB2_02 = ~z~All that for this crappy piece of land.

HMSTD_S2_AMB2_03 = ~z~I never wanted to be here in the first place...

HMSTD_S2_AMB3A_01 = ~z~At least we don't have to work now.

HMSTD_S2_AMB3A_02 = ~z~Can we just go home already?

HMSTD_S2_AMB3A_03 = ~z~This was a bad idea from the start...

HMSTD_S2_AMB3B_01 = ~z~Can't we just leave it now?

HMSTD_S2_AMB3B_02 = ~z~Who's going to buy this shithole?

HMSTD_S2_AMB3B_03 = ~z~At least we're almost done.

HMSTD_S2_AMB3C_01 = ~z~I can't believe this.

HMSTD_S2_AMB3C_02 = ~z~Why can't we just quit?

HMSTD_S2_AMB3C_03 = ~z~I'm done with this.

HMSTD_S2_ATKM1_1 = ~z~What the hell's your problem?

HMSTD_S2_ATKM2_1 = ~z~Just leave me alone.

HMSTD_S2_ATKM3_1 = ~z~Hey, what are you doing?

HMSTD_S2_ATKM4_1 = ~z~Just cut it out, will you?

HMSTD_S2_BODY1_1 = ~z~You a bounty hunter, mister?

HMSTD_S2_BODY2_1 = ~z~Ain't sure you should be carrying them around on our land.

HMSTD_S2_CBT1_1 = ~z~Hey, hey, what's going on here?

HMSTD_S2_CBT2_1 = ~z~Just take it easy, come on.

HMSTD_S2_DIR_1 = ~z~I think my father might want your help.

HMSTD_S2_DIR_2 = ~z~Maybe he'll yell at someone else for a change.

HMSTD_S2_DYN1_1 = ~z~Hey, what's the dynamite for?

HMSTD_S2_DYN2_1 = ~z~That seems a real bad idea, mister.

HMSTD_S2_HTF1_1 = ~z~Hey, leave her alone.

HMSTD_S2_HTF2_1 = ~z~What are you doing to that woman?

HMSTD_S2_HTM1_1 = ~z~Hey, what are you doing?

HMSTD_S2_HTM2_1 = ~z~You can't do that! Let him go.

HMSTD_S2_NEG1_1 = ~z~You boys don't seem cut out for this.

HMSTD_S2_NEG1_2 = ~z~Oh, I agree. We ain't. This was our pa's dumb idea.

HMSTD_S2_NEG2_1 = ~z~What, you can't even defend yourself?

HMSTD_S2_NEG2_2 = ~z~He won't let us have no guns. I just want to go home now.

HMSTD_S2_NEG3A_1 = ~z~You fools are never going to finish this place.

HMSTD_S2_NEG3A_2 = ~z~I know, but try telling that to our pa.

HMSTD_S2_NEG3B_1 = ~z~You can't think this piece of shit is worth anything?

HMSTD_S2_NEG3B_2 = ~z~I don't even care. I just want to be done with it.

HMSTD_S2_POS1_1 = ~z~Having fun there?

HMSTD_S2_POS1_2 = ~z~This is the exact opposite of fun, mister.

HMSTD_S2_POS2_1 = ~z~You'll be alright, just stick it out.

HMSTD_S2_POS2_2 = ~z~I just want to go back home.

HMSTD_S2_POS3A_1 = ~z~Looks like you're almost finished.

HMSTD_S2_POS3A_2 = ~z~And now we're broke. I swear we'll never be rid of this place.

HMSTD_S2_POS3B_1 = ~z~Looks like you're almost done.

HMSTD_S2_POS3B_2 = ~z~I sure hope so. God, I can't wait to get out of here.

HMSTD_S2_STEAL1_1 = ~z~Hey, you can't just take that.

HMSTD_S2_STEAL2_1 = ~z~I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

HMSTD_S2_STEAL3_1 = ~z~Stop taking our stuff, damn it.

HMSTD_S2_STEAL4_1 = ~z~Right from under my nose, you bastard.

HMSTD_S3_ILOANT_1 = ~z~Looks like it'd blow down in a light breeze.

HMSTD_S3_ILOANT_2 = ~z~Hey, come on, don't kick a feller while he's down.

HMSTD_S3_ILOGRT_1 = ~z~Looks like you're making progress at least.

HMSTD_S3_ILOGRT_2 = ~z~Sure don't feel like it.

HMSTD_SONS_FIRE_1 = ~z~Why does he yell at us like that?

HMSTD_SONS_FIRE_2 = ~z~If he don't like the way we're doing it, he should do it himself.

HMSTD_SONS_FIRE_3 = ~z~Damn straight.

HMSTD_SONS_FIRE_4 = ~z~Let's just enjoy the silence for a few minutes, before he starts griping at us again.

HMSTD_STEAL1_01 = ~z~Hey, that ain't yours to take!

HMSTD_STEAL1_02 = ~z~No more of that, you hear me?

HMSTD_STEAL2_01 = ~z~Will you keep your hands off our property?

HMSTD_STEAL2_02 = ~z~Thieving bastard.

HOME2_NEG_AO_1 = ~z~You make a sorry trio, I gotta say.

HOME2_NEG_ILO_1 = ~z~You make a sorry trio, I gotta say.

HOME2_NEG_ILO_2 = ~z~It's just been one thing after the next. Can't wait to just be shut of the place.

HOME2_POS_AO_1 = ~z~You'll be alright, just stick it out.

HOME2_POS_ILO_1 = ~z~You'll be alright, just stick it out.

HOME2_POS_ILO_2 = ~z~I hope you're right.

HOME_AGGRO_1 = ~z~Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?

HOME_ATAK03_1 = ~z~That's right, that's right... you better run.

HOME_ATAK04_1 = ~z~~sl:1.5:2.6:1~Don't reckon they'll be back any time soon.

HOME_ATAKFP_01 = ~z~Yeah! Give it to those sons of bitches!

HOME_ATAKFP_02 = ~z~That's it! Get 'em!

HOME_ATAKFP_03 = ~z~Shoot them, the damn crooks!

HOME_ATAKF_01 = ~z~I ain't paying you a damn cent!

HOME_ATAKF_02 = ~z~You can't intimidate me!

HOME_ATAKF_03 = ~z~I'll kill all you bastards!

HOME_ATAKILO_1 = ~z~What the hell is going on?

HOME_ATAKILO_1_1 = ~z~What the hell is going on?

HOME_ATAKILO_1_2 = ~z~They think it's their land. But it ain't.

HOME_ATAKILO_2 = ~z~Just help us out here!

HOME_ATAKILO_2_1 = ~z~What's all this about?

HOME_ATAKILO_2_2 = ~z~Help us, please!

HOME_ATAKP2_1 = ~z~Not gonna tell you again, get the hell outta here. Now.

HOME_ATAKP3_1 = ~z~I'm done with this son of a bitch. Take him out, boys.

HOME_ATAKP_1 = ~z~Hey! Get outta here. This doesn't concern you.

HOME_ATAKR_01 = ~z~We told you not to build on this land.

HOME_ATAKR_02 = ~z~We've given you enough chances.

HOME_ATAKR_03 = ~z~Should'a paid up. Stubborn old fool.

HOME_ATAK_1 = ~z~I won't be pushed around by the likes of you!

HOME_BYE_2A_1 = ~z~Stay out of trouble.

HOME_BYE_2A_2 = ~z~I'll try...

HOME_BYE_2B_1 = ~z~You seem to be back on track anyway. I'll see you later.

HOME_BYE_2B_2 = ~z~Yup. For now, at least...

HOME_BYE_3AN_1 = ~z~I'm gonna get out of here before you try to scrounge anything else off me.

HOME_BYE_3AN_2 = ~z~Hey, you don't ask, you don't get.

HOME_BYE_3AY_1 = ~z~Bye then...I'll keep an eye out for that lumber.

HOME_BYE_3AY_2 = ~z~I appreciate it.

HOME_BYE_3B_1 = ~z~I'll be back later for what you owe me.

HOME_LN01ANA_01 = ~z~You got some nerve coming back here! Get the hell out of my sight or you'll be sorry!

HOME_LN01ANA_02 = ~z~What the hell do you want now? Ain't you done enough to hurt us? Leave us the hell alone!

HOME_LN01ANA_03 = ~z~No, you get the hell out of here! Stay away from my family!

HOME_LN01ANN_01 = ~z~Just keep your mouth shut or this visit'll go a lot worse.

HOME_LN01ANN_02 = ~z~You better watch that mouth before you go and make me angry again.

HOME_LN01ANN_03 = ~z~Careful, my friend. You don't want to get me all riled up again.

HOME_LN01ANP_01 = ~z~There was me thinking we'd put all that behind us.

HOME_LN01ANP_02 = ~z~Alright, keep your shirt on. Just paying my regards.

HOME_LN01ANP_03 = ~z~Guess you're still carrying that grudge, huh?

HOME_LN01ANW_1 = ~z~No, no, no! Get out of here! We don't want your help, not after what you did!

HOME_LN01EA_1 = ~z~Turned out pretty nice, huh? Just sold it to a farmer moving up here from the south.

HOME_LN01EA_2 = ~z~As much trouble as it was, I... think I might actually miss the place.

HOME_LN01E_1 = ~z~Well hey there! What do you think? Turned out pretty nice, didn't it?

HOME_LN01E_2 = ~z~Time for me to move on, though. Just sold it to a farmer moving up here from the south.

HOME_LN01NPA_1 = ~z~No, no, you go away! We don't need you raising no more hell round here!

HOME_LN02ANA_01 = ~z~That means leave! I don't want to see you around here.

HOME_LN02ANA_02 = ~z~Go on, get out of here! I don't want to see your face.

HOME_LN02ANA_03 = ~z~Are you listening to me? You ain't welcome here.

HOME_LN02EAN_1 = ~z~I can't believe you got somebody to buy that pile of scrap wood.

HOME_LN02EAN_2 = ~z~Alright. If that's how you're gonna be, I'm leaving.

HOME_LN02EAP_1 = ~z~Yeah, doesn't look half bad. Glad it all worked out for you.

HOME_LN02EAP_2 = ~z~Yep. Well, I should be making tracks. All the best to you.

HOME_LN02ERN_1 = ~z~Just give me my money.

HOME_LN02ERP_1 = ~z~Good for you. So, can I have my money now?

HOME_LN02NPA_1 = ~z~What's your problem? Can't you just leave us alone?

HOME_LN03AJA_1 = ~z~Alright, sure. Take it. Ain't like I got much use for it.
