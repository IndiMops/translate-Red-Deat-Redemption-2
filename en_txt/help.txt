PMHELP_CRIME_WANTEDCOPKILL = If you injure an officer of the law, or shake out of an arrest attempt, then the law will no longer attempt to capture you alive - they will shoot to kill.

PMHELP_CRIME_WANTEDLKDN = As you commit more crimes in a region, lawmen and civilians become more vigilant, eventually placing the region on Lockdown. This turns the region map red and prevents use of local shops and events until enough time passes or your bounty is paid.

PMHELP_DOM_3S = In an All Threes game, points can be earned at the end of every turn by totaling the number of pips at each open end of the chain. If this edge value is a multiple of 3, then the player scores that number of points.

PMHELP_DOM_3SDIAGRAM = In this example, the edge score is 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 15, so the person who last played scored 15 points. For their next turn the player could play any tile which has a 5, 4 or a 3 on either end. A point-scoring move in All Threes would be to play 3-3 on the right, bringing the edge score to 5 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 18.

PMHELP_DOM_3STIP = In some circumstances a player might choose to make lower scoring or non-scoring, but strategic moves. This could serve to block other players, bluff about the tiles they have in hand, or save the most valuable tiles for later when they may be worth more points.

PMHELP_DOM_3SWIN = As with Draw and Block games, the round ends either when a player downs their last tile or the round is blocked. The winner receives the total of their opponents' pips, rounded up or down to the nearest 3. Games continue with new rounds until a player reaches the target score of 90.

PMHELP_DOM_3S_HDR = All Threes

PMHELP_DOM_5S = All Fives games follow the same rules as All Threes, but players only score points when the edge score is a multiple of five - 5, 10, 15 or 20.

PMHELP_DOM_BLOCK = A Block game follows the same rules as Draw, but there is no boneyard, so players cannot draw new tiles.

PMHELP_DOM_BLOCK_HDR = Block

PMHELP_DOM_DRAW = In a Draw game, the aim of the game is to be the first player to put down all of your Dominoes.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAWBLOCK = If no player can make a move, then the round is blocked and the winner is the player with the lowest pip count on their remaining tiles.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAWDIAGRAM = In this example, the next player would need to either place a tile with 5 pips on the left, or 1 on the right.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAWLINE = The player who has drawn the highest double (tile with the same number of pips on each side) begins the game by placing it, face-up, in the middle of the table. If no player has a highest double, the player with the highest value tile will go first. This creates the “line of play” and the other players, in turn, extend it by selecting tiles from their hand with matching numbers of pips on one side and placing them against the tile on the board.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAWPASS = If a player can't place any of their tiles on their turn, they must take a new one from the boneyard until they get a playable tile. Once the boneyard is empty, they pass. Play goes on like this until one player wins the round by downing their last tile.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAWRACK = Dominoes are placed face down or in a rack facing the player, so that all players can see how many tiles their opponents have remaining, but can only see the pips on their own.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAWTILES = There are 28 unique tiles in a dominoes set. Each player begins with seven, drawn at random, and any remaining dominoes are placed into the boneyard.

PMHELP_DOM_DRAW_HDR = Draw

PMHELP_DOM_HDR = Dominoes

PMHELP_DOM_SPIN = Double tiles are always placed at right angles to the other tiles. In All Threes or All Fives, the first double tile played is called a 'spinner'. Once tiles have been played off both sides of a spinner, the line of play can then branch out in four directions by playing tiles off each end of a spinner.

PMHELP_DOM_SPIN_HDR = Spinners

PMHELP_DOM_TIP = As a round of dominoes goes on, a canny player will be able to guess their opponents' hands by surveying the tiles already played and noting when other players have to draw or pass. This allows for strategic moves to block other players.

PMHELP_FISH_BAIT = Fishing with a bobber uses perishable baits such as bread and worms. Baits are cheap and readily available but are often lost whilst fishing, such as fish sometimes escaping with the bait if you miss a firm bite, so you will often need to rebait your hook.

PMHELP_FISH_BAITTIP = When bobber fishing, cast out and keep your bait still to attract fish. The bobber rests on the surface of the water and is connected by fishing line to the hook with a bait attached to it.

PMHELP_FISH_BAIT_HDR = Bait

PMHELP_FISH_BIGFISH = 'Pump' the Fishing Rod to make faster progress hauling in a hooked fish. Pull down ~INPUTGROUP_MINIGAME_FISHING_LSTICK_ALL~ to drag the fish towards you then quickly reel in line.

PMHELP_FISH_BITETIP = Each species bites at the bait differently. Some species nibble cautiously until taking a firm bite, other species are more confident and will repeatedly take firm bites. Predator species can bite suddenly without warning, so, when waiting for a bite, be ready to strike at all times.

PMHELP_FISH_LUREBIG = Lure fishing is more difficult than bobber fishing due to the need to keep the lure moving, but will attract much larger fish species.

PMHELP_FISH_LURETIP = Once you have cast out using a lure, keep reeling it in slowly to make it look like a little swimming fish or insect. A stationary lure just looks like an inanimate hunk of metal so will not attract any fish.

PMHELP_FISH_TIPFLICK = You can flick your Fishing Rod to help attract fish if you are not getting any bites, but doing so too often will spook them.

PMHELP_FISH_TIPS_HDR = Tips

PMHELP_FISH_TIPTOD = Fish activity is affected by weather and time of day. Fish are more active whilst it is raining and during cloudy days, compared to when it's sunny.

PMHELP_FISH_TIRE = When a hooked fish is struggling, it will aggressively swim to try and get away. Control the fish by pulling the rod left or right in the opposite direction to the fish movement. This will tire the fish so that it struggles less, making it easier to reel in.

PMHELP_FISH_UI = ~INPUT_OPEN_WHEEL_MENU~ - hold to display bait wheel~n~~INPUT_MINIGAME_FISHING_QUICK_EQUIP~ - press to quick equip bait~n~~INPUT_AIM~ - hold to grip rod~n~~INPUT_ATTACK~ - hold then release to cast out~n~~INPUT_MINIGAME_FISHING_HOOK~ - press to hook a fish / tap to flick bait~n~~INPUTGROUP_MOVE~ - move rod~n~~INPUTGROUP_LOOK~ - rotate clockwise to reel in~n~~INPUT_MINIGAME_FISHING_RESET_CAST~ - reset cast / cut line
