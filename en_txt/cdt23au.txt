CDT23_ACTA_1 = ~z~Abigail, John, come here.

CDT23_ACTA_2 = ~z~Listen to this. It's like I've been telling you all of these years.

CDT23_ACTA_3 = ~z~What is?

CDT23_ACTA_4 = ~z~Oh this passage by Mr. Miller, I can't believe I never read this before. Listen.

CDT23_ACTA_5 = ~z~All of you, listen to this!

CDT23_ACTA_6 = ~z~Get on with it.

CDT23_ACTA_7 = ~z~

CDT23_ACTA_8 = ~z~"The whole point of America is freedom.

CDT23_ACTA_9 = ~z~Freedom of thought, freedom of deed, freedom of action.

CDT23_ACTA_10 = ~z~Yet how have most of our brethren responded to having their yokes cast off by getting on that boat from Europe?

CDT23_ACTA_11 = ~z~By enslaving themselves.

CDT23_ACTA_12 = ~z~They may no longer be serfs tending some master's field and giving him rights of refusal on their wives,

CDT23_ACTA_13 = ~z~but they have found themselves new masters in the relentlessness of ownership.

CDT23_ACTA_14 = ~z~The attemps at dominion over the land have enslaved them, not the land.

CDT23_ACTA_15 = ~z~In owning things, people, businesses, the former serfs of Europe have become not masters, not stewards,

CDT23_ACTA_16 = ~z~but intellectual dwarfs managed by the world quite as much as Europe's enduring peasantry.

CDT23_ACTA_17 = ~z~And in many ways, more so for they are tricked into believing they are free, whereas the peasant knows he is trapped."

CDT23_ACTB_1 = ~z~Isn't that... isn't that the truest thing you ever heard?

CDT23_ACTB_2 = ~z~Not... not quite the truest... the truest thing I ever heard was this.

CDT23_ACTB_3 = ~z~My little boy crying 'cause he didn't have enough to eat.

CDT23_ACTB_4 = ~z~Meaning?

CDT23_ACTB_5 = ~z~Meaning fine words butter no parsnips, as I used to hear.

CDT23_ACTB_6 = ~z~Excuse me... enjoy your book, Dutch.

CDT23_ACTC_ALT_1 = ~z~I think it went over her head.
