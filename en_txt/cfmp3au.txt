CFMP3_ACT_1 = ~z~

CFMP3_ACT_2 = ~z~Here's the way I see it, if you're interested. Everything changes.

CFMP3_ACT_3 = ~z~I grew up wanting to hunt whales.

CFMP3_ACT_4 = ~z~My father and his father both hunted sperm whales... everyone's fathers did where I grew up.

CFMP3_ACT_5 = ~z~And we lit the world with that oil, we lit the world. And oh, and we lived like princes,

CFMP3_ACT_6 = ~z~with our moms wearing new dresses and our dads out to sea for years at a time. Rich and lonely, but desperate to be out there.

CFMP3_ACT_7 = ~z~And then, as I'm finishing school and getting to ready to ship out to sea myself, everything ends.

CFMP3_ACT_8 = ~z~Nobody wants whale oil no more. Everybody's running west, for gold and land and oil and freedom.

CFMP3_ACT_9 = ~z~So I spend a couple years at sea, but it's not what I imagined. Without the hunt, it's not really anything.

CFMP3_ACT_10 = ~z~I don't want to simply carry things across the sea, I want to pull things from it.

CFMP3_ACT_11 = ~z~So I too go west.

CFMP3_ACT_12 = ~z~And soon I fall into some terrible trouble with some really bad men I meet. They force me to marry a woman so they can steal all my money. But...

CFMP3_ACT_13 = ~z~Then Dutch finds me, very much at my wit's end. And, you boys know the rest of that story.

CFMP3_ACT_14 = ~z~Now I'm a ship's cook... for a camp with no ship!

CFMP3_ACT_15 = ~z~With no ship!

CFMP3_ACT_16 = ~z~But I miss the sea. I do... it calms you somehow.
