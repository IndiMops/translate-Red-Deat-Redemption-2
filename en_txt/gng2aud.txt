GNG2_ARTH_REPLY_1 = ~z~How did you get out of this?

GNG2_BBANT1_1 = ~z~Right, time to catch a few vapors of our own.

GNG2_BBANT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~It's a little overcast, but I'm expecting some good wind...~sl:~once we're high enough.

GNG2_BBANT1_3 = ~z~We should still have some decent views over the river.

GNG2_BBANT2_1 = ~z~Now one hates to be coarse, but on the subject of ablutions.

GNG2_BBANT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Liquids over the side, solids...~sl:~do your utmost to levee the situation until we land.

GNG2_BBANT2_3 = ~z~Okay, Mr. Bullard.

GNG2_BBANT2_4 = ~z~I had a client once who fell foul to a rotten oyster on the ascent.

GNG2_BBANT2_5 = ~z~A decidedly harrowing experience for all involved.

GNG2_BBANT3_1 = ~z~Did you breakfast in the city this morning, Mr. Morgan?

GNG2_BBANT3_2 = ~z~Not exactly.

GNG2_BBANT3_3 = ~z~Well, I have a boiled egg in my pocket here that you're very welcome to.

GNG2_BBANT3_4 = ~z~I think I'm alright, thank you. Recalling the ablutions discussion.

GNG2_BBANT3_5 = ~z~Well, just say the word.

GNG2_BBANT4_1 = ~z~So, if I may ask, what got you interested in the pursuit of aviation?

GNG2_BBANT4_2 = ~z~I didn't exactly. Mrs. Adler thought she'd surprise me.

GNG2_BBANT4_3 = ~z~~sl:0.3~A very nice woman. And no shrinking violet.

GNG2_BBANT4_4 = ~z~Definitely not.

GNG2_BBANT4_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~I prefer slightly more feminine attire on a lady, but...~sl:~variety is the very spice of life, as they say.

GNG2_BBANT4_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Or is it though?~sl:0.3~Did you know they locked up the man who wrote that in a mental asylum?

GNG2_BBANT4_7 = ~z~I did not, Mr. Bullard.

GNG2_B_C_01 = ~z~More heat now. We are going to crash!

GNG2_B_C_02 = ~z~Go up, quick.

GNG2_B_C_03 = ~z~Sir, please! We are dangerously low here.

GNG2_B_FAT_1 = ~z~A slightly slower ascent than normal, but we're carrying some weight...

GNG2_B_FAT_2 = ~z~between us here. Two gentlemen with a healthy appetite.

GNG2_B_GH_01 = ~z~Okay, we are getting a little high now.

GNG2_B_GH_02 = ~z~Maybe ease off on the throttle there, sir.

GNG2_B_GH_03 = ~z~Whoa there, no need to go any higher.

GNG2_B_GL_01 = ~z~You might want to go a little higher there, sir.

GNG2_B_GL_02 = ~z~Add a little more heat, Mr. Morgan.

GNG2_B_GL_03 = ~z~Up the heat now, we're a little low.

GNG2_B_HAT_1 = ~z~And may I say, a bold choice of hat, sir.

GNG2_B_HAT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.5:1~I'm all for rising above the crowd... and the cloud for that matter.

GNG2_B_HAT_3 = ~z~~sl:1.0~Yeah, very good, Mr. Bullard.

GNG2_B_P_01 = ~z~This is good. Nice air flow here.

GNG2_B_P_02 = ~z~And looks like we are moving again.

GNG2_B_P_03 = ~z~That's it, try to keep us around this height.

GNG2_B_TH2_01 = ~z~Are you listening, sir? We need to be lower.

GNG2_B_TH2_02 = ~z~I told you, we need to descend or we won't move.

GNG2_B_TH2_03 = ~z~Didn't you hear me? Please reduce the altitude.

GNG2_B_TH_01 = ~z~We are too high, sir. The air isn't moving.

GNG2_B_TH_02 = ~z~We need to be lower, there's not enough wind at this altitude.

GNG2_B_TH_03 = ~z~Please descend a little, there isn't enough wind at this height.

GNG2_B_TL_01 = ~z~More heat, we are too low.

GNG2_B_TL_02 = ~z~We have to gain some altitude, sir.

GNG2_B_TL_03 = ~z~Ascend, the wind isn't strong enough at this altitude.

GNG2_EXT_1 = ~z~The hell is wrong with you?

GNG2_EXT_2 = ~z~I only left you an hour ago.

GNG2_EXT_3 = ~z~You can't stay out of trouble for one goddamn hour?

GNG2_EXT_4 = ~z~You got that poor bastard killed for his troubles.

GNG2_EXT_5 = ~z~I kind of liked him.

GNG2_EXT_6 = ~z~They got Colm.

GNG2_EXT_7 = ~z~The government...

GNG2_EXT_8 = ~z~they got Colm O'Driscoll.

GNG2_EXT_9 = ~z~They're gonna hang him in Saint Denis.

GNG2_EXT_10 = ~z~Hang him?

GNG2_EXT_11 = ~z~Okay.

GNG2_EXT_12 = ~z~He's already been tried twice for murder...

GNG2_EXT_13 = ~z~and found guilty.

GNG2_EXT_14 = ~z~Sure, and no doubt he'll escape again.

GNG2_EXT_15 = ~z~No he won't...

GNG2_EXT_16 = ~z~'cause we're gonna make sure of it.

GNG2_EXT_17 = ~z~I...

GNG2_EXT_18 = ~z~We have our own problems with the law...

GNG2_EXT_19 = ~z~in case you ain't noticed.

GNG2_EXT_20 = ~z~Dutch'll wanna see him swing.

GNG2_EXT_21 = ~z~Sure... Dutch, he wouldn't even help us with Marston...

GNG2_EXT_22 = ~z~and our situation is really messed up right now.

GNG2_EXT_23 = ~z~You know how things is.

GNG2_EXT_24 = ~z~Bastard's gonna swing...

GNG2_EXT_25 = ~z~I'm gonna make sure of it.

GNG2_EXT_26 = ~z~Closely followed by Marston!

GNG2_EXT_27 = ~z~You saw him?

GNG2_EXT_28 = ~z~Yes...

GNG2_EXT_29 = ~z~in the fields.

GNG2_EXT_30 = ~z~Okay...

GNG2_EXT_31 = ~z~then we go rescue him.

GNG2_EXT_32 = ~z~From a state penitentiary?

GNG2_EXT_33 = ~z~No...

GNG2_EXT_34 = ~z~but from the fields, yes.

GNG2_EXT_35 = ~z~That we can manage.

GNG2_EXT_36 = ~z~It's well guarded.

GNG2_EXT_37 = ~z~Guarded, sure, but not behind bars.

GNG2_EXT_38 = ~z~No, he's not behind bars.

GNG2_EXT_39 = ~z~So, that's how we'll do it...

GNG2_EXT_40 = ~z~bust him from his work detail.

GNG2_EXT_41 = ~z~I guess.

GNG2_EXT_42 = ~z~It's best just the two of us go.

GNG2_EXT_43 = ~z~The two of us is all there is anyhow.

GNG2_EXT_44 = ~z~Good because two is all we'll need.

GNG2_EXT_45 = ~z~I'll get us a boat, a little one...

GNG2_EXT_46 = ~z~and we'll sneak in and get him outta there.

GNG2_EXT_47 = ~z~Meet me at Copperhead Landing.

GNG2_EXT_48 = ~z~Thank you, Arthur.

GNG2_EXT_49 = ~z~Whatever you say, boss.

GNG2_EXT_50 = ~z~I heard that.

GNG2_FTA_AB_01 = ~z~What are you doing? Ascend, I said.

GNG2_FTA_AB_02 = ~z~We need to get higher, before they shoot us down.

GNG2_FTA_DUCKED_01 = ~z~Oh my Lord.

GNG2_FTA_DUCKED_02 = ~z~Didn't I tell you this would happen?

GNG2_FTA_DUCKED_03 = ~z~This is absolutely insane.

GNG2_FTA_GA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.9~The wind speed is picking up... we should stay at this altitude. It's...

GNG2_FTA_GA_2 = ~z~heading north westerly, so that should take us back to land.

GNG2_FTA_GA_3 = ~z~Dear God, I'm shaking like a leaf.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT1_1 = ~z~This particular vessel is state of the art, sir, imported from Europe.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT1_2 = ~z~You won't find more than a couple of these on this side of the pond.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT1_3 = ~z~So long as it works.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT2_1 = ~z~You sure you shouldn't be doing this?

GNG2_FTPI_BANT2_2 = ~z~Oh, not at all. A child could operate this, with a little supervision.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1~Besides, Mrs. Adler told me you were very keen to learn the ropes,~sl:~and we have plenty of those.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT2_4 = ~z~She did, did she?

GNG2_FTPI_BANT3_1 = ~z~Arthur and Arturo, how perfect is this?

GNG2_FTPI_BANT3_2 = ~z~My mother was a keen student of the Italianate.

GNG2_FTPI_BANT3_3 = ~z~My brother's called Baldassario, so you could say I got off lightly...

GNG2_FTPI_BANT3_4 = ~z~Look, I'm trying to concentrate here.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD1_1 = ~z~Keep going, sir. We need to get up above the clouds.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD1_2 = ~z~It really is stunning up there, you'll have seen nothing like it.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD2_1 = ~z~Oh... my God.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.4~Yes, heavenly indeed. Quite remarkable, isn't it?~sl:0.3:2.6~And feels like we have a nice westerly wind so...~sl:~keep her around this height.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD3_01 = ~z~That's it, steady wins the race.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD3_02 = ~z~Keep on going, you're doing splendidly.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD3_03 = ~z~Very good, keep doing what you're doing.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD4_01 = ~z~Don't stop, sir. We should keep ascending.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD4_02 = ~z~We aren't high enough yet. Give it a good pull there.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD4_03 = ~z~We won't get anywhere fast if you don't use the burner, sir.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD5_1 = ~z~Alright then, let's break through these clouds.

GNG2_FTPI_CLD6_1 = ~z~Ah, that's better. Look, we can see for miles now.

GNG2_FTPI_GOOD_1 = ~z~Very good... see, you're a natural.

GNG2_FTPI_GOOD_2 = ~z~The wind is blowing south westerly so keep her around this height.

GNG2_FTPI_GOOD_3 = ~z~Perfect day for a little tour.

GNG2_FTPI_GOOD_4 = ~z~We should have some nice views over the Lannahechee River.

GNG2_FTPI_HIGHR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~That's it, keep going.~sl:~We need more altitude so we can get up some speed.

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN1_1 = ~z~See that building up ahead on the island?

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN1_2 = ~z~That's the infamous Sisika Penitentiary.

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN2_1 = ~z~We shouldn't fly too near to it, though, sir?

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN2_2 = ~z~Sorry, we're going in for a closer look.

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN2_3 = ~z~What do you mean?

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN3_1 = ~z~Mr. Morgan, please, this is most irregular.

GNG2_FTPI_PRSN3_2 = ~z~You want a happy customer, don't you?

GNG2_IG3_1 = ~z~~sl:1.0:0.0~The wind... well this is most unusual.

GNG2_IG3_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Relax, Mr. Bullard... here, take over.~sl:1.0~Keep us well away...

GNG2_IG3_3 = ~z~I'll do my best... this filly isn't the easiest to control, you know.

GNG2_IG9_1 = ~z~~sl:1.6:2.2:1~Good grief... I've been...

GNG2_IG9_ROPEA_1 = ~z~Sadie!

GNG2_IG9_ROPEA_2 = ~z~~sl:1.0:0.0~Grab the rope, c'mon. Grab the rope!

GNG2_IG9_ROPE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7:1~Sadie!

GNG2_IG9_ROPE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Grab the rope, c'mon.~sl:1.2~Grab the rope!

GNG2_IG10_FAIL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3:1~Oh, my arms...

GNG2_IG10_FAIL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Arthur!~sl:1.2~Pull me up!

GNG2_IG10_OHSH_1 = ~z~Oh shit!

GNG2_IG10_PLLUP_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1:1~Arthur! Get me up there!

GNG2_IG10_PLLUP_02 = ~z~I can't hold on much longer!

GNG2_IG10_PLLUP_03 = ~z~~sl:1.8:0.0~Arthur, hurry!

GNG2_IG10_PLLUP_04 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4:1~Pull me up!

GNG2_IG10_SCRM_1 = ~z~

GNG2_IG11_P1_1 = ~z~Ah, my God!

GNG2_IG11_P1_2 = ~z~What are you doing?

GNG2_IG11_P1_3 = ~z~They're shooting at us!

GNG2_IG11_P1_4 = ~z~I can see that.

GNG2_IG11_P1_5 = ~z~Ascend! Ascend!

GNG2_IG11_P2_1 = ~z~Alright, we're in the clear now, Mr. Bullard. You can get up.

GNG2_IG11_P2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.9:2.9:1~Good Lord, my heart is pounding.

GNG2_IG11_P2_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~I must say,~sl:0.0:3.8:1~the specifics of this job were not described to me at all sufficiently.

GNG2_IG11_P2_4 = ~z~Well, it's done now.

GNG2_IG_INT_WT1_1 = ~z~You coming?

GNG2_IG_INT_WT2_1 = ~z~I guess.

GNG2_IG_INT_WT_1 = ~z~You know that part.

GNG2_IG_INT_WT_2 = ~z~I do.

GNG2_IG_INT_WT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5:1~And Hosea?

GNG2_IG_INT_WT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8:1~Saw that too.

GNG2_IG_INT_WT_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Well, we got Lenny's body out as well.~sl:~Robbed the morgue and buried them together.

GNG2_INT_1 = ~z~Any problems coming in?

GNG2_INT_2 = ~z~Nah.

GNG2_INT_3 = ~z~Guess they know now we ain't in the city.

GNG2_INT_4 = ~z~Who? Mr. Milton's friends?

GNG2_INT_5 = ~z~Yeah, they've had patrols out ever since you boys disappeared.

GNG2_INT_6 = ~z~Well, at least you're alive.

GNG2_INT_7 = ~z~For now, yeah.

GNG2_INT_8 = ~z~What happened in...

GNG2_INT_9 = ~z~Guarma?

GNG2_INT_10 = ~z~Yeah.

GNG2_INT_11 = ~z~Nothing nice.

GNG2_INT_12 = ~z~What happened to Dutch?

GNG2_INT_13 = ~z~'Cause he seems...

GNG2_INT_14 = ~z~I don't know.

GNG2_INT_15 = ~z~Seems as...

GNG2_INT_16 = ~z~what began happening in Blackwater, began happening...

GNG2_INT_17 = ~z~years ago, maybe.

GNG2_INT_18 = ~z~A slow decline, I guess.

GNG2_INT_19 = ~z~What do you mean?

GNG2_INT_20 = ~z~I ain't quite sure.

GNG2_INT_21 = ~z~What happened here?

GNG2_INT_22 = ~z~I started gathering people up...

GNG2_INT_23 = ~z~as best I could after you boys left.

GNG2_INT_24 = ~z~And John...

GNG2_LIFT_OFF_01 = ~z~Up, up and away.

GNG2_LIFT_OFF_02 = ~z~Okay, here goes nothing.

GNG2_LJ_BI_1 = ~z~Look, this isn't funny now. What on earth are you doing?

GNG2_LJ_BI_2 = ~z~The guards are bound to spot us.

GNG2_LJ_BI_3 = ~z~Calm down. They won't care if we stay high enough.

GNG2_LJ_BI_4 = ~z~I'm just looking for a friend of mine.

GNG2_LJ_BI_5 = ~z~A friend?

GNG2_LJ_BI_6 = ~z~Poor bastard has a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

GNG2_LJ_BI_7 = ~z~I heard they got him working the fields in a chain gang.

GNG2_LJ_BI_8 = ~z~Dear God.

GNG2_LJ_FJ_1 = ~z~Yep, that's him...

GNG2_LJ_MJ_01 = ~z~Is that him?

GNG2_LJ_MJ_02 = ~z~~sl:0.7:0.0~That could be him...

GNG2_LJ_MJ_03 = ~z~Looks like him... it's hard to tell, though...

GNG2_LJ_MJ_04 = ~z~Wait, is that him?

GNG2_LJ_NB_1 = ~z~Okay, he ain't by the barn.

GNG2_LJ_NERVOUS_01 = ~z~Please hurry.

GNG2_LJ_NERVOUS_02 = ~z~I can't believe we're doing this.

GNG2_LJ_NERVOUS_03 = ~z~This was not the tour I had in mind.

GNG2_LJ_NERVOUS_04 = ~z~We look a little suspicious, wouldn't you say?

GNG2_LJ_NERVOUS_05 = ~z~Should we, er, think about heading back?

GNG2_LJ_NH_01 = ~z~Not in this field.

GNG2_LJ_NH_02 = ~z~Best try another spot.

GNG2_LJ_NH_03 = ~z~Alright, let's try one of the other fields.

GNG2_LJ_NJ_01 = ~z~That's not him.

GNG2_LJ_NJ_02 = ~z~That ain't John.

GNG2_LJ_NJ_03 = ~z~Nope, not there.

GNG2_LNCH_DAWD_01 = ~z~Just give it a good yank, don't be shy.

GNG2_LNCH_DAWD_02 = ~z~Nothing to be afraid of, Mr. Morgan.

GNG2_LNCH_DAWD_03 = ~z~Off we go then, it really is relatively safe.

GNG2_MCS1_1 = ~z~This is my friend I told you about.

GNG2_MCS1_2 = ~z~Mr. Morgan.

GNG2_MCS1_3 = ~z~Ah yes, Arturo Bullard, at your service, sir...

GNG2_MCS1_4 = ~z~at your service.

GNG2_MCS1_5 = ~z~Arthur Morgan.

GNG2_MCS1_6 = ~z~Well, it's a nice fresh day for flying, sir.

GNG2_MCS1_7 = ~z~A day like today...

GNG2_MCS1_8 = ~z~and Icarus would have made it across the sea.

GNG2_MCS1_9 = ~z~You ever flown before, sir?

GNG2_MCS1_10 = ~z~No.

GNG2_MCS1_11 = ~z~Oh, it's quite a thing...

GNG2_MCS1_12 = ~z~quite a thing.

GNG2_MCS1_13 = ~z~Now...

GNG2_MCS1_14 = ~z~put these on and hop in.

GNG2_MCS1_15 = ~z~Well ain't she coming?

GNG2_MCS1_16 = ~z~Oh, women can't fly, sir...

GNG2_MCS1_17 = ~z~are you insane?

GNG2_MCS1_18 = ~z~They can't?

GNG2_MCS1_19 = ~z~Oh no, sir, does terrible damage to them...

GNG2_MCS1_20 = ~z~to their...

GNG2_MCS1_21 = ~z~vapors.

GNG2_MCS1_22 = ~z~I thought everyone knew about that.

GNG2_MCS1_23 = ~z~Why, a delicate flower like Mrs. Adler...

GNG2_MCS1_24 = ~z~heavens above...

GNG2_MCS1_25 = ~z~or below.

GNG2_MCS1_26 = ~z~Where'd you find this guy?

GNG2_MCS1_27 = ~z~I told you you two would get on.

GNG2_MCS1_28 = ~z~Are you sure about this?

GNG2_MCS1_29 = ~z~Certain, sir, quite certain.

GNG2_MCS1_30 = ~z~Missus...

GNG2_MCS1_31 = ~z~let us away.

GNG2_MCS1_32 = ~z~Wish us luck!

GNG2_MCS1_LI_1 = ~z~Mr. Bullard?

GNG2_MCS1_LI_2 = ~z~

GNG2_MCS1_LI_3 = ~z~Mr. Bullard.

GNG2_MCS1_LI_4 = ~z~Ah, Mrs. Adler. It's good to see you.

GNG2_MCS1_LI_5 = ~z~Good to see you.

GNG2_MCS1_LO_1 = ~z~I've only crashed twice...

GNG2_MCS1_LO_2 = ~z~

GNG2_MCS1_LO_3 = ~z~Now, pull on that rope... and hope for the best.

GNG2_MCS1_LO_4 = ~z~

GNG2_MCS1_LO_SD_1 = ~z~You boys have fun.

GNG2_MCS1_LO_SD_2 = ~z~

GNG2_MCS2_1 = ~z~Ah, there's Annesburg.

GNG2_MCS2_2 = ~z~Sure.

GNG2_MCS2_3 = ~z~Good Lord, is that...

GNG2_MCS2_4 = ~z~is that Mrs. Adler?

GNG2_MCS2_5 = ~z~Where?

GNG2_MCS2_6 = ~z~Being chased.

GNG2_MCS2_7 = ~z~Yes.

GNG2_MCS2_8 = ~z~Try and get us near her.

GNG2_MCS2_9 = ~z~Will there be more trouble, sir?

GNG2_MCS2_10 = ~z~I expect so.

GNG2_MCS3_1 = ~z~Come here.

GNG2_MCS3_2 = ~z~I think we're gonna crash.

GNG2_MCS3_3 = ~z~You have a real habit of stating the obvious, Arthur.

GNG2_MCS3_4 = ~z~Hold on!

GNG2_MCS3_5 = ~z~Did you break your neck?

GNG2_MCS3_6 = ~z~I don't think so...

GNG2_MCS3_7 = ~z~maybe.

GNG2_MCS3_8 = ~z~Damn it, look.

GNG2_MCS3_9 = ~z~There's more of them on the other side.

GNG2_MCS3_10 = ~z~They must have followed us.

GNG2_MCS3_11 = ~z~Get behind something...

GNG2_MCS3_12 = ~z~this ain't over yet.

GNG2_PS_BEHIND_1 = ~z~Look out! More coming in behind us!

GNG2_PS_PSH2_01 = ~z~C'mon! Let's move up and finish these bastards.

GNG2_PS_PSH2_02 = ~z~C'mon, let's go get these sons of bitches.

GNG2_PS_PSH_01 = ~z~You fuckers, I'll kill you all!

GNG2_PS_PSH_02 = ~z~I'll kill every last one of ya!

GNG2_PS_SADYELL_01 = ~z~How many of you does it take, huh?

GNG2_PS_SADYELL_02 = ~z~You boys are a goddamn joke!

GNG2_PS_SADYELL_03 = ~z~Send every last son of a bitch you got!

GNG2_PS_SADYELL_04 = ~z~You ain't goddamn men!

GNG2_PS_SADYELL_05 = ~z~You can tell Colm he's next!

GNG2_PS_SADYELL_06 = ~z~You're all gonna pay for what you did!

GNG2_PS_SOSTART_1 = ~z~These goddamn O'Driscolls.

GNG2_PS_SOSTART_2 = ~z~You can't leave it for one day?

GNG2_PS_SOSTART_3 = ~z~Just kill these sons of bitches!

GNG2_PS_SQ0_1 = ~z~They're trying to come around behind us!

GNG2_PS_SQ0_2 = ~z~Get back to the basket.

GNG2_PS_SQ2_01 = ~z~Shit! There's even more of them coming out of the woods!

GNG2_PS_SQ2_02 = ~z~Goddamn it! We got more coming out of the woods there.

GNG2_PS_SQ3A_1 = ~z~Nearly there! Only a few of them left.

GNG2_PS_SQ3B_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Look at those cowards. Yeah, you run,~sl:~I'll catch up with you soon enough!

GNG2_PS_SQ3D_1 = ~z~Looks like we made it... that'll show 'em.

GNG2_PS_YELL1_1 = ~z~Hey, Sadie! Up here.

GNG2_PS_YELL1_2 = ~z~You're just in time!

GNG2_PS_YELL2_1 = ~z~Come on, Arthur! Let's finish these bastards!

GNG2_PS_YELL2_2 = ~z~Just ride, I'll deal with 'em.

GNG2_RTB_FL_1 = ~z~Follow me.
