LBPER_F4_NOISE_05 = ~z~What was that noise?

LBPER_F5_CORPSE_01 = ~z~Shit, we've got a problem here!

LBPER_F5_CORPSE_03 = ~z~Look out, there's a body over here!

LBPER_FLEEC_03 = ~z~Okay, Etta, let's get out of this shithole!

LBPER_FLEE_01 = ~z~Right behind you, Etta!

LBPER_FLEE_02 = ~z~It's a bust, let's go!

LBPER_FLEE_03 = ~z~You heard the boss, time to go!

LBPER_GBANT1B_01 = ~z~Seen anything yet?

LBPER_GBANT1B_02 = ~z~I'll have a look over this side.

LBPER_GBANT1B_03 = ~z~They was right about the security... place is dead.

LBPER_GBANT1B_04 = ~z~Keep an eye out for ammunition, dynamite, lockboxes...

LBPER_GBANT1B_05 = ~z~I'll never get tired of robbing Cornwall...

LBPER_GBANT1B_06 = ~z~Sooner we get out of here, the better... place gives me the creeps.

LBPER_GBANT1C_01 = ~z~Nothing yet, they had any luck over the other side?

LBPER_GBANT1C_02 = ~z~Keep your eyes skinned for any more guards. Two seems real light.

LBPER_GBANT1C_03 = ~z~Oil, rail, sugar... is there any pies Cornwall doesn't have his fat fingers in?

LBPER_GBANT1C_04 = ~z~Watch for any movements inside the buildings.

LBPER_GBANT1C_05 = ~z~Ain't it kinda strange they'd have this stuff stashed out in the yard here? I don't know...

LBPER_GBANT1C_06 = ~z~Make sure you check every corner, girls.

LBPER_GBANT1_01 = ~z~Everything looks the damn same in here.

LBPER_GBANT1_02 = ~z~Check everything twice if you need to.

LBPER_GBANT1_03 = ~z~I'm guessing it'll be something with a lock on it.

LBPER_GBANT1_04 = ~z~Reminds me of that factory we hit in Phoenix.

LBPER_GBANT1_05 = ~z~This is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

LBPER_GBANT1_06 = ~z~Keep your eyes open, something doesn't feel right about this.

LBPER_GBANT2A_1 = ~z~Those guards still out cold?

LBPER_GBANT2A_2 = ~z~Seem it, I think this ones still breathing...

LBPER_GBANT2A_3 = ~z~I thought I saw this one move a little, should I hit him again?

LBPER_GBANT2A_4 = ~z~Nah he's good, out like a light.

LBPER_GBANT2A_5 = ~z~Peaceful aint they?

LBPER_GBANT2A_6 = ~z~Should check the pockets on this one.

LBPER_GBANT3B_01 = ~z~I'll be ready for a drink after this, that's for sure.

LBPER_GBANT3B_02 = ~z~I'd like to see the look on Cornwall's face when he finds out about this.

LBPER_GBANT3B_03 = ~z~Makes a change from robbing trains, I guess.

LBPER_GBANT3B_04 = ~z~Wouldn't call this easy money so far.

LBPER_GBANT3B_05 = ~z~If this is what the city smells like, they can keep it.

LBPER_GBANT3C_01 = ~z~Seems far too quiet 'round here...

LBPER_GBANT3C_02 = ~z~Can't believe we passed over that coach job for this.

LBPER_GBANT3C_03 = ~z~If we don't find nothing soon, I reckon we just split.

LBPER_GBANT3C_04 = ~z~Maybe we're too late? Maybe they moved it out already...

LBPER_GBANT3C_05 = ~z~We could really use some good money after those last two jobs.

LBPER_GBANT3_01 = ~z~Etta said this one should be 'the' one, we can lay low for a while after this.

LBPER_GBANT3_02 = ~z~Never goes easy, does it?

LBPER_GBANT3_03 = ~z~Next stop, Doyle's Tavern for me. I'm parched.

LBPER_GBANT3_04 = ~z~Who gave us this tip anyway?

LBPER_GBANT3_05 = ~z~All in a day's work, I guess.

LBPER_GBANT4_01 = ~z~All looking a little too calm if you ask me.

LBPER_GBANT4_02 = ~z~Better be something big after all this.

LBPER_GBANT4_03 = ~z~It'd help if I knew what I was looking for.

LBPER_GBANT4_04 = ~z~Christ, could be anywhere.

LBPER_GBANT4_05 = ~z~I said we should just go rob a bank.

LBPER_GUARDEXPA_1 = ~z~To hell with this. Let's shoot them, less trouble.

LBPER_GUARDEXPA_2 = ~z~Yeah. Sweet dreams.

LBPER_GUARDEXPA_3 = ~z~Okay, you take that one, I'll take this one.

LBPER_GUARDEXPA_4 = ~z~Yeah to hell with them.

LBPER_GUARDEXPA_5 = ~z~Shoot him, don't need this pair waking up.

LBPER_GUARDEXPA_6 = ~z~Fine by me.

LBPER_HIT_01 = ~z~Ow!

LBPER_HIT_02 = ~z~Go to hell!

LBPER_HIT_03 = ~z~Hey!

LBPER_HIT_04 = ~z~Oh, you wait!

LBPER_HIT_05 = ~z~Damn you!

LBPER_HIT_06 = ~z~Is that all you got?

LBPER_HOLDUP1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Whoa... the hell are you doing?~sl:~This is private property.

LBPER_HOLDUP1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~I count four guns to two, and I know which four are faster,~sl:~so I'd strongly advise you boys to lower those rifles. Now!

LBPER_HOLDUP1_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Okay, look...~sl:~we just work here, we don't want no trouble.

LBPER_HOLDUP1_5 = ~z~Too late for that.

LBPER_HOLDUP1_6 = ~z~Wait, please!

LBPER_HOLDUP1_7 = ~z~Okay, girls, come on. Let's tear this place apart.

LBPER_IDLE_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~You ain't ready to do this, are you?~sl:0.3~Just cut me loose and move on with your life.

LBPER_IDLE_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~Come on. Stop dragging this out and be smart.~sl:0.2~You made a mistake, but you still got time to fix it.

LBPER_IDLE_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~What the hell are you doing? Stop pussyfooting around.~sl:0.3~Just get it over with or let me go.

LBPER_IG6_ALT1_1 = ~z~Shit, we've been set up, girls! They spun us a goddamn yarn.

LBPER_IG6_ALT1_2 = ~z~We need to get out of here and quick. All of you, let's go!

LBPER_IG6_ALT2_1 = ~z~Damn it, I think this is a trap. There's nothing worth shit.

LBPER_IG6_ALT2_2 = ~z~We best get the hell out of here. You hear me? Now! Come on!

LBPER_IG6_ALT3_1 = ~z~For chrissakes, there's no goddamn loot. This is a sham, girls. We need to get out of here right now. Quick, let's go!

LBPER_IG6_ALT3_2 = ~z~

LBPER_IG6_REVL_01 = ~z~~sl:0.9:5.2~Christ, there's nothing. This is a goddamn set-up.~sl:0.0:2.2~We need to get the hell out of here...~sl:~come on, quick, let's move out!

LBPER_IG6_REVL_02 = ~z~~sl:1.9:4.2~For chrissakes, there's no goddamn loot.~sl:0.0:4.2~This is a sham, girls. We need to get out of here right now.~sl:~Quick, let's go!

LBPER_IG8_LGO1_1 = ~z~Okay, boss.

LBPER_IG8_LGO2_1 = ~z~You heard Etta, come on, let's go!

LBPER_IG8_SRH1A_01 = ~z~Still no luck, Etta.

LBPER_IG8_SRH1A_02 = ~z~Nothing over this way, Etta.

LBPER_IG8_SRH1B_1 = ~z~Nothing over this way, Etta.

LBPER_IG8_SRH2A_01 = ~z~I don't see anything here, boss.

LBPER_IG8_SRH2A_02 = ~z~I got nothing here, boss.

LBPER_IG8_SRH2B_1 = ~z~I got nothing here, boss.

LBPER_IG8_SRH3A_01 = ~z~Shit, thought I had something for a second here.

LBPER_IG8_SRH3A_02 = ~z~A whole lot of nothing this way, boss.

LBPER_IG8_SRH3B_1 = ~z~A whole lot of nothing this way, boss.

LBPER_INT_BINK_1 = ~z~Alright.

LBPER_INT_BINK_3 = ~z~Used to be known as Madame La Perle.

LBPER_INT_BINK_4 = ~z~She runs a gang of other fallen women.

LBPER_INT_BINK_5 = ~z~Sticking up trains and coaches mostly.

LBPER_INT_BINK_6 = ~z~But seems to have a particular fancy for robbing...

LBPER_INT_BINK_7 = ~z~Leviticus Cornwall of late.

LBPER_INT_BINK_8 = ~z~So, his men have set a honeypot to lure her in.

LBPER_INT_BINK_9 = ~z~Tipped her off about a big stash of money and ammunition at...

LBPER_INT_BINK_10 = ~z~Cornwall's freight yard in Saint Denis.

LBPER_INT_BINK_11 = ~z~Asked if I can send some good bounty hunters their way.

LBPER_INT_BINK_12 = ~z~Just be careful...

LBPER_INT_BINK_13 = ~z~they play smart.

LBPER_INT_BINK_14 = ~z~Oh, looks like she only sent one.

LBPER_INT_BINK_15 = ~z~This must be them.

LBPER_INT_BINK_16 = ~z~Okay. We gotta move fast here, come on.

LBPER_INT_BINK_17 = ~z~Now, the bait's already been set.

LBPER_INT_BINK_18 = ~z~Etta Doyle and her girls could be here any minute.

LBPER_INT_BINK_19 = ~z~And Mr. Cornwall...

LBPER_INT_BINK_20 = ~z~he don't want his name anywhere near this...

LBPER_INT_BINK_21 = ~z~for reasons I'm sure you can understand.

LBPER_INT_BINK_22 = ~z~Just wants it dealt with quick and quiet.

LBPER_INT_BINK_23 = ~z~You're gonna wanna ensconce yourself in here.

LBPER_INT_BINK_24 = ~z~Now, wait 'til they bust in...

LBPER_INT_BINK_25 = ~z~and then, when the moment's right...

LBPER_INT_BINK_26 = ~z~ambush Miss Doyle, and escort her into custody.

LBPER_INT_BINK_27 = ~z~They want her alive.

LBPER_INT_BINK_28 = ~z~You get paid, we get rid of her.

LBPER_INT_BINK_29 = ~z~Everyone's happy.

LBPER_INT_BINK_30 = ~z~Now, don't worry about her cronies...

LBPER_INT_BINK_31 = ~z~she's the one with the price on her head.

LBPER_INT_BINK_32 = ~z~They're notorious for dressing alike...

LBPER_INT_BINK_33 = ~z~so you bide your time, you figure out which one's Doyle.

LBPER_INT_BINK_34 = ~z~You'll know for sure when you see her face.

LBPER_INT_BINK_35 = ~z~Gotta big old scar down her right cheek.

LBPER_INT_BINK_36 = ~z~We're just gonna hang around and stand guard.

LBPER_INT_BINK_37 = ~z~Create some semblance of security...

LBPER_INT_BINK_38 = ~z~and just pray the crazy bitch don't bust in and shoot us straight in the face.

LBPER_INT_BINK_39 = ~z~Alright now, it's time.

LBPER_INT_BINK_40 = ~z~Find a place to hide, and we'll wait for the guest of honor.

LBPER_LASSO_01 = ~z~Damn it!
