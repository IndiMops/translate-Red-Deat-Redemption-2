CAUNC_INT_LI_GT_1 = ~z~What you want?

CAUNC_KILLMULTI_01 = ~z~Stop it, you maniac!

CAUNC_KILLMULTI_02 = ~z~This is the last time I ask you for help.

CAUNC_KILLMULTI_03 = ~z~Stop shooting the money!

CAUNC_KILLMULTI_04 = ~z~What the hell is wrong with you?

CAUNC_KILLMULTI_05 = ~z~Arthur! Are you trying to make me lower your cut?

CAUNC_KILLONE_01 = ~z~Jesus.

CAUNC_KILLONE_02 = ~z~Hey, what're you doing?

CAUNC_KILLONE_03 = ~z~Woah, what'd you do that for?

CAUNC_KNOCK_1 = ~z~Shit... he knocked himself out.

CAUNC_LOUD_1 = ~z~This was your plan?

CAUNC_MOUNTUP_1 = ~z~Okay, let's mount up.

CAUNC_NEWSTRAG_01 = ~z~Ah, one's got away from us.

CAUNC_NEWSTRAG_02 = ~z~I think one of 'em run off.

CAUNC_NEWSTRAG_03 = ~z~Wait, have we lost one?

CAUNC_NOHORSE_01 = ~z~Let's go then.

CAUNC_NOHORSE_02 = ~z~Come on, we ain't rustling on foot, my friend.

CAUNC_NOHORSE_03 = ~z~I was talking about now, if there's any confusion on the matter.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_1 = ~z~So how you find out about this place?

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_2 = ~z~Been hanging around the saloon in Rhodes a bit.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_3 = ~z~In Rhodes?

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_4 = ~z~Yeah, the barkeep there gossips like a fishwife, and a couple of times

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_5 = ~z~he's mentioned how this rancher's a falldown drunk these days.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_6 = ~z~Sounds like he don't know his ass from his armpit half the time.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_7 = ~z~You sure you ought to be hanging around Rhodes after everything happened?

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_8 = ~z~What you mean?

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_9 = ~z~I mean that it ain't gonna do your health no good if they find out you ride with us.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_10 = ~z~Nah, it's fine. I was never there at the same time as you boys.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_11 = ~z~And they'd never reckon on a distinguished old feller like me

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_12 = ~z~running with a bunch of reprobates.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_13 = ~z~Just be careful. How old are you anyway?

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_14 = ~z~Let's just say I was born sometime between the fall of '49 and the fall of Rome.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_15 = ~z~My second wife always used to describe me as ageless,

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_16 = ~z~though she did leave me for a younger man.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_17 = ~z~Maybe we should cut you open and count the rings of whisky.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_18 = ~z~I am ready for my retirement, though, let me tell you.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_19 = ~z~You've been pretty much retired from the moment I met you.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_20 = ~z~I mean the tropics. The real deal. What Dutch is talking about.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_21 = ~z~That's why I jumped on this opportunity. Sooner we get enough money to leave, the better.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_22 = ~z~Dancing girls with flowers in their hair. Warm sand, cold beer.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_23 = ~z~That's how I'm gonna see out my days.

CAUNC_RIDEBANT1_24 = ~z~Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

CAUNC_RIDESTART_1 = ~z~So where's this ranch?

CAUNC_RIDESTART_2 = ~z~It's right in the middle of Scarlett Meadows, just past the Rhodes turnoff.

CAUNC_RIDETURN_1 = ~z~We're going to cut up this way!

CAUNC_RIDEUPA_1 = ~z~Alright, let's get up there on foot from here,

CAUNC_RIDEUPA_2 = ~z~don't want the horses clopping around outside the window.

CAUNC_RIDEUPA_3 = ~z~Didn't you say he'll be out cold all night?

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_8 = ~z~fifty bucks.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_9 = ~z~Okay...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_10 = ~z~fifty bucks each, times twenty cattle...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_11 = ~z~N-No, fifty total.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_12 = ~z~This is old Squears' cattle, he knows me...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_13 = ~z~I can't do better than that...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_14 = ~z~I'll have to move 'em right away.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_15 = ~z~We'll take two hundred, friend.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_16 = ~z~But, I got costs...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_17 = ~z~One fifty.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_18 = ~z~Seventy five and not a dollar more.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_19 = ~z~One hundred...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_20 = ~z~and I don't shoot you.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_21 = ~z~So menacing...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_22 = ~z~Clive, pay your friend here.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_23 = ~z~Bye now, be careful out there...

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_24 = ~z~this is nasty country.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_25 = ~z~Here, don't forget to put some in the pot.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_26 = ~z~Of course... like I told you, easy.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_27 = ~z~Sure, I guess.

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_28 = ~z~I'm heading home, you coming?

CAUNC_RUST2_EXT_29 = ~z~Nah, I'll see you later.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_1 = ~z~What you want?

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_2 = ~z~Don't be like that...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_3 = ~z~this is a good 'un.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_4 = ~z~Yeah, it always is with you...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_5 = ~z~until we start getting shot at.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_6 = ~z~Well, have you ever been shot at by a cow?

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_7 = ~z~Whose cows?

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_8 = ~z~He's a drunken rancher up at Hill Haven Ranch.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_9 = ~z~He's such a flop that...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_10 = ~z~we could take a whole marching band up there and steal 'em...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_11 = ~z~and he still wouldn't wake up.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_12 = ~z~Yeah, and he's a son of a bitch.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_13 = ~z~He said unkind things about me.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_14 = ~z~He ain't all bad then.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_15 = ~z~Now, I owe you after last time...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_16 = ~z~this could be my make good.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_17 = ~z~I don't know.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_18 = ~z~I need you...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_19 = ~z~you know those two bastards who'd buy stolen livestock.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_20 = ~z~Sure, I know 'em...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_21 = ~z~but I don't like 'em.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_22 = ~z~I'll give you sixty percent of the take.

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_23 = ~z~How many cows?

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_24 = ~z~I don't know, a small herd I guess...

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_25 = ~z~twenty maybe?

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_26 = ~z~Twenty, huh?

CAUNC_RUST2_INT_27 = ~z~Come on.

CAUNC_SHOTLOCK_1 = ~z~That was loud.

CAUNC_SHOTLOCK_2 = ~z~Yeah, well, we ain't got time. You said he ain't gonna wake up, and we ain't seen him yet.

CAUNC_THANKS_1 = ~z~Thanks for the help with this, Arthur.

CAUNC_TRAMPLE_01 = ~z~Careful.

CAUNC_TRAMPLE_02 = ~z~Arthur! Don't trample them.

CAUNC_TRAMPLE_03 = ~z~Hey watch the damn cows with that horse of yours.

CAUNC_WAIT1_1 = ~z~Let's sneak up closer.

CAUNC_WAIT1_2 = ~z~What? Where the hell are you going?

CAUNC_WAIT1_3 = ~z~I think I've got a plan.

CAUNC_WAIT2_1 = ~z~So... what now?

CAUNC_WAIT2_2 = ~z~I thought you had a plan?

CAUNC_WAIT2_3 = ~z~I ain't so sure, now.

CAUNC_WAIT2_4 = ~z~Christ, I'll take care of them.

CAUNC_WAIT3_1 = ~z~They're in! They're getting our cows.

CAUNC_WAIT3_2 = ~z~I can see that! Shut up.

CAUNC_WAIT4_1 = ~z~They're leaving. We gotta stop 'em, come on.

CAUNC_WAITGATH_1 = ~z~I'll get 'em out. Ride up next to the house to keep them from running off on us.

CAUNC_WAITGATH_2 = ~z~Got it.

CAUNC_WAITHERD_01 = ~z~I'll stick with the herd till you catch up.

CAUNC_WAITHERD_02 = ~z~I'll keep up with the herd, don't want them running off.

CAUNC_WAITHERD_03 = ~z~I better wait with the herd.

CAUNC_WALKUP_1 = ~z~C'mon, let's take a closer look.
