RRTL_2_AMBUSH_1 = ~z~Now, where's this shine?

RRTL_2_GETIN_1 = ~z~That's shine, alright. Let's get you home.

RRTL_2_WAGBLIP_1 = ~z~Who we got here?

RRTL_3_FOLLOW_01 = ~z~Don't worry about me. Speak to the chief, and I'll have that chair ready.

RRTL_3_FOLLOW_02 = ~z~Just... clearing out the old cobwebs. You have business with the chief, my friend.

RRTL_3_FOLLOW_03 = ~z~This is all... part of my process. You have your own work to do, do you not? Now move along.

RRTL_3_POSTCS_1 = ~z~Excellent. Excellent.

RRTL_3_POSTCS_2 = ~z~All this wonderful methanol.

RRTL_3_RET_PROF_01 = ~z~Speak to the chief, and I'll put the finishing touches to my machine.

RRTL_3_RET_PROF_02 = ~z~You're doing a great service, sir. And a lucrative one, to boot.

RRTL_3_RET_PROF_03 = ~z~Hurry, my friend. The sooner you speak to the chief, the sooner we can show everyone.

RRTL_3_RET_PROF_04 = ~z~It's all too much, I can't believe this is really happening. Let me... oh... a good walk will clear my mind.

RRTL_4_POST_1 = ~z~Why this is all coming together wonderfully.

RRTL_4_POST_2 = ~z~The final piece of the puzzle.

RRTL_4_RET_PROF_01 = ~z~He's a lucky man, this Mr. McDaniels. He'll have a place in the history books.

RRTL_4_RET_PROF_02 = ~z~Never shall a man have been so humanely dispatched as this poor wretch McDaniels. Please assure him of that.

RRTL_4_RET_PROF_03 = ~z~Off you go and fetch the man. His kindly and noble executioner awaits.

RRTL_4_RET_PROF_04 = ~z~I have only a few more adjustments to make. Please hurry with our subject. Science awaits him.

RRTL_6_ALLDEAD_1 = ~z~You killed them all, you animal.

RRTL_6_BRING_01 = ~z~Bring him over here.

RRTL_6_BRING_02 = ~z~Bring him to me.

RRTL_6_CHECK1_1 = ~z~Mr. McDaniels?

RRTL_6_CHECK1_2 = ~z~

RRTL_6_CHECK2_1 = ~z~Mr. McDaniels? How you doing back there?

RRTL_6_CHECK2_2 = ~z~

RRTL_6_CHECK3_1 = ~z~You okay, Mr. McDaniels? You're awful quiet.

RRTL_6_CHECK3_2 = ~z~

RRTL_6_CHECK3_3 = ~z~Okay.

RRTL_6_CUTLOOSE_01 = ~z~What you playing at, mister?

RRTL_6_CUTLOOSE_02 = ~z~Wait, what you doing, huh?

RRTL_6_ESCAPE_01 = ~z~You won't see me again!

RRTL_6_ESCAPE_02 = ~z~I'm going!

RRTL_6_FLEE_01 = ~z~Hold this ground. I'm falling back. Shit.

RRTL_6_FLEE_02 = ~z~Hold him here, I'm moving positions. Goddamn.

RRTL_6_HIT1A_1 = ~z~Sounds like sour grapes.

RRTL_6_HOGTIED_01 = ~z~Goddamn government cat's paw.

RRTL_6_HOGTIED_02 = ~z~Born free. I was born free goddamn you.

RRTL_6_HOGTIED_03 = ~z~Cat's paw bastard.

RRTL_6_HOGTIED_04 = ~z~You're your own jail keeper, mister. In a prison of your own making.

RRTL_6_HOGTIE_1 = ~z~Come on. Do I got a special treat for you.

RRTL_6_MOAN_01 = ~z~

RRTL_6_MOAN_02 = ~z~

RRTL_6_MOAN_03 = ~z~

RRTL_6_MOAN_04 = ~z~

RRTL_6_MOAN_05 = ~z~

RRTL_6_MSDEAD_1 = ~z~They gone? I'm sorry about that, McDaniels. You alright?

RRTL_6_MSDEAD_2 = ~z~

RRTL_6_MSDEAD_3 = ~z~Uh huh. Me too. Well, you'll be happy to know we ain't got far to go. Hold on tight now.

RRTL_6_MSDEAD_4 = ~z~

RRTL_6_NEARPROF_1 = ~z~Well, here we are. The professor will be real pleased to meet you.

RRTL_6_NEARPROF_2 = ~z~No.

RRTL_6_OFFHORSE_1 = ~z~Come on. Don't be shy now. Let's go.

RRTL_6_ONHORSE1_1 = ~z~Up ya get.

RRTL_6_ONHORSE2_1 = ~z~Take me to damn court then.

RRTL_6_RAGE1_1 = ~z~This ain't America. We ain't free no more.

RRTL_6_RAGE1_2 = ~z~Can't raise no animals, take no wives.

RRTL_6_RAGE1_3 = ~z~All I did was graze my livestock. Married them that needed marrying. And killed any that tried to stop it.

RRTL_6_RAGE1_4 = ~z~I ain't wrong. It's you that's wrong.

RRTL_6_RAGE1_5 = ~z~We was trying to live free, and you come along and laid waste.

RRTL_6_RAGE1_6 = ~z~Take me in. Just take me to the jail house.

RRTL_6_RBANT_1 = ~z~You know, you ain't going to court, and you ain't going to jail either...

RRTL_6_RBANT_2 = ~z~I'm taking you to a professor I know.

RRTL_6_RBANT_3 = ~z~What the hell you talking about?

RRTL_6_RBANT_4 = ~z~You're a lucky man, mister. You get to be part of... a great experiment.

RRTL_6_RBANT_5 = ~z~Shut up.

RRTL_6_RBANT_6 = ~z~You ain't going to die needlessly, is what I mean.

RRTL_6_RBANT_7 = ~z~Nope, your death's going to be an... important step in the advancement of human knowledge.

RRTL_6_RBANT_8 = ~z~What in hell you saying, mister?

RRTL_6_RBANT_9 = ~z~This professor, Andrew Bell the third, I believe he said, he's a little odd, and maybe hare-brained,

RRTL_6_RBANT_10 = ~z~but I got no reason to doubt the quality of his work.

RRTL_6_RBANT_11 = ~z~What's this damned professor got to do with anything?

RRTL_6_RBANT_12 = ~z~He wants to try his new electricity chair on you. To kill you. Humanely.

RRTL_6_RBANT_13 = ~z~No?

RRTL_6_RBANT_14 = ~z~Yes. He's going to strap you into this contraption, and run a large electric current through your system.

RRTL_6_RBANT_15 = ~z~It's got something to do with moonshine. But I don't quite know what.

RRTL_6_RBANT_16 = ~z~Guess that's why he's the professor and I'm the bounty catcher.

RRTL_6_RBANT_17 = ~z~As I said, I can pass on his assurances that this is a most humane way to go.

RRTL_6_RBANT_18 = ~z~It will be just like... well... like switching off a light.

RRTL_6_RBANT_19 = ~z~They wouldn't let you do this to me. They wouldn't.

RRTL_6_RBANT_20 = ~z~Oh, they would. We got a permit and everything.

RRTL_6_RBANT_21 = ~z~You was in animal husbandry, am I right?

RRTL_6_RBANT_22 = ~z~Well, you ever seen lightning strike livestock, Mr. McDaniels?

RRTL_6_RBANT_23 = ~z~I ain't ever seen the actual impact, but I came across a pasture some time after.

RRTL_6_RBANT_24 = ~z~Storm had just cleared and there was smoke in the air, smell of burning hair.

RRTL_6_RBANT_25 = ~z~No.

RRTL_6_RBANT_26 = ~z~Must been a dozen head of cattle, lying there, piled up, mangled. Strange scars across their backs, legs, necks.

RRTL_6_RBANT_27 = ~z~Half like they was burned... and half like the skin was ripped off of them.

RRTL_6_RBANT_28 = ~z~No.

RRTL_6_RBANT_29 = ~z~Eyes bleeding. Some of 'em popped out.

RRTL_6_RBANT_30 = ~z~No.

RRTL_6_RBANT_31 = ~z~If I hadn't seen the storm, well, I would have thought some devil caused that mischief.

RRTL_6_RBANT_32 = ~z~But, no sir, it was lightning. Electricity does something, alright.

RRTL_6_RBANT_33 = ~z~I seen trees explode in front of me.. I seen desert sand baked into glass. That's what I seen lighting do.

RRTL_6_RBANT_34 = ~z~But, hey. This electricity the professor's got planned for you... why that must be of an entirely different kind.

RRTL_6_RBANT_35 = ~z~

RRTL_6_SPOTPLY_1 = ~z~Hey. Who the hell's this feller?

RRTL_6_SPOTPLY_2 = ~z~Shit. We got a visitor.

RRTL_6_WHATSUP_01 = ~z~What are you waiting for?

RRTL_6_WHATSUP_02 = ~z~Come on... let me get a look at him, please.

RRTL_6_WHATSUP_03 = ~z~Get him into position.

RRTL_CALL_01 = ~z~Bud.

RRTL_CALL_02 = ~z~Excuse me.

RRTL_CALL_03 = ~z~Hello.

RRTL_CALL_04 = ~z~Can I trouble you?

RRTL_CALL_05 = ~z~My good man.

RRTL_CALL_06 = ~z~Won't take but a moment of your time.

RRTL_CALL_07 = ~z~Buddy old pal.

RRTL_RET_PROF_01 = ~z~Will you speak to your friend in Rhodes for me?

RRTL_RET_PROF_02 = ~z~That moonshine is rather integral to my plans.

RRTL_RET_PROF_03 = ~z~Get me that methanol and the world will thank you, friend. I promise you.

RRTL_RET_PROF_04 = ~z~Moonshine... the rougher the better. That's what I need my friend.

RRTL_WAITING_01 = ~z~Yes, yes, you sir.

RRTL_WAITING_02 = ~z~Excellent.

RRTL_WAITING_03 = ~z~Well, well.

RRTL_WAITING_04 = ~z~Yes, yes.

RRTL_WAITING_05 = ~z~I thought you looked nice.

RRTL_WAITING_06 = ~z~Good stuff.

RRTL_WAITING_07 = ~z~Ah... ah...

RTL2_RC1_LI_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Listen... bit of a weird question, but...~sl:0.2~do you know where I might find some moonshine?

RTL2_RC1_LI_2 = ~z~What?

RTL2_RC1_LI_3 = ~z~Moonshine. You know, strong liquor... over strong.

RTL2_RC1_LI_CO_1 = ~z~Ah, excuse me, bud.

RTL2_RC1_LI_GRT_1 = ~z~What?

RTL2_RC1_LI_GRT_2 = ~z~

RTL_1_POST1_1 = ~z~You are in for a sight, my friend. Just as soon as I get my hands on that methanol.

RTL_1_POST1_2 = ~z~What a helpful fellow.

RTL_2_DRIVER_1 = ~z~Hey.

RTL_2_ENMY1_1 = ~z~Shine's here.

RTL_2_ENMY1_2 = ~z~Okay. Sit tight, fellers. We're still waiting on them's that buying it.

RTL_4_CHIEFN_1 = ~z~Sir, welcome to our humble Police House.

RTL_4_CHIEFWHAT_01 = ~z~What can I do for you?

RTL_4_CHIEFWHAT_02 = ~z~Can I help you with something?

RTL_4_CHIEFWHAT_03 = ~z~I can't possibly help you, if you don't tell me what you need.

RTL_4_CHIEFY_1 = ~z~I know you, sir, the bounty chaser.

RTL_4_CHOICEW_01 = ~z~What's it going to be?

RTL_4_CHOICEW_02 = ~z~Well?

RTL_4_CHOICEW_03 = ~z~Sir?

RTL_4_CHOICEW_04 = ~z~Uh huh?

RTL_4_CHOICEW_05 = ~z~Yes?

RTL_4_CHOICE_1 = ~z~That's a bit steep for me, alright. I'm going to go away and think about it.

RTL_4_CHOICE_2 = ~z~You do that, I'll be here.

RTL_4_CNXT_N1_1 = ~z~You should be paying us... how about we give you half?

RTL_4_CNXT_N1_2 = ~z~No permit, no execution, mister. It's a hundred and fifty in fees.

RTL_4_CNXT_N_1 = ~z~I don't like asking, but I need permission to demonstrate a chair that executes with electricity.

RTL_4_CNXT_N_2 = ~z~You know you want it, so scribble on some paper, and I'll get it done for you.

RTL_4_CNXT_N_3 = ~z~I don't like your tone, mister. But I heard about this professor's invention, and I am interested.

RTL_4_CNXT_N_4 = ~z~For a hundred and fifty dollars in fees, I will write you a permit.

RTL_4_CNXT_N_5 = ~z~

RTL_4_CNXT_P1_1 = ~z~Hey, look, this will save you money in the long run, and...

RTL_4_CNXT_P1_2 = ~z~it'll save the condemned a whole lot of pain.

RTL_4_CNXT_P1_3 = ~z~That remains to be seen, but... I'll give you the permit for fifty.

RTL_4_CNXT_P_1 = ~z~Chief, I'm representing the inventor of a humane execution machine, an electric chair.

RTL_4_CNXT_P_2 = ~z~And he, uh, wants to demonstrate his invention here.

RTL_4_CNXT_P_3 = ~z~I'm familiar with the man and his work.

RTL_4_CNXT_P_4 = ~z~Tell you what, I'll give you a permit, but it's going to cost you a hundred dollars in fees.

RTL_4_MONEYW_01 = ~z~Anything else I can help you with?

RTL_4_MONEYW_02 = ~z~You haven't found that money, have you?

RTL_4_MONEYW_03 = ~z~If you've decided to get that permit, you can just pay up.

RTL_4_MONEYW_04 = ~z~You stay here much longer, I might get you a cell.

RTL_4_MONEYW_05 = ~z~If you want the permit, just get me that money, sir.

RTL_4_NMGREET_01 = ~z~Ah, you're back. Do you have that money?

RTL_4_NMGREET_02 = ~z~Well, well, are you here to pay for your permit?

RTL_4_NMGREET_03 = ~z~I do hope you're here to pay for a demonstration, sir.

RTL_4_NOMONEY_1 = ~z~Look, I don't have that money on me. I'll come back and see you soon.

RTL_4_NOMONEY_2 = ~z~And I'll be here waiting.

RTL_4_PAYS_NEG_1 = ~z~Fine. Take the money.

RTL_4_PAYS_NEG_2 = ~z~Very good. And here is your permit. Pending the usual formalities.

RTL_4_PAYS_NEG_3 = ~z~Such as finding a poor wretch to sit in that chair.

RTL_4_PAYS_NEG_4 = ~z~I guess that makes sense. I'll tell the professor.

RTL_4_PAYS_NEG_5 = ~z~So long.

RTL_4_PAYS_POS_1 = ~z~Okay, well, the price is fair. Here you go.

RTL_4_PAYS_POS_2 = ~z~And here, sir, is your permit. Pending the usual formalities, of course.

RTL_4_PAYS_POS_3 = ~z~Such as finding a suitable candidate for... humane dispatchment.

RTL_4_PAYS_POS_4 = ~z~I'll tell that to the professor.

RTL_4_PAYS_POS_5 = ~z~Good luck.

RTL_4_PERMITW_01 = ~z~You got the permit, there anything else?

RTL_4_PERMITW_02 = ~z~There was me thinking you was in a rush.

RTL_4_PERMITW_03 = ~z~Go on... show that permit to whoever's got to see it.

RTL_4_PERMITW_04 = ~z~Now you're just taking up space in my Police House.

RTL_4_PERMITW_05 = ~z~I said au revoir.

RTL_6_ATTACK_1 = ~z~We ain't got time for this, just kill 'em.

RTL_6_BKUP_1 = ~z~That's the feller that took our moonshine!

RTL_6_DROP_01 = ~z~Put him down just here.

RTL_6_DROP_02 = ~z~Now lay him over here.

RTL_6_ESCP_01 = ~z~Get away from me!

RTL_6_ESCP_02 = ~z~Stay back!

RTL_6_ESCP_03 = ~z~Shit.

RTL_6_ESCP_04 = ~z~Nah, nah. No.

RTL_6_ESCP_05 = ~z~Ya, won't take me, you bastard.

RTL_6_FIGHT1_01 = ~z~Get that son of a bitch!

RTL_6_FIGHT1_02 = ~z~Protect me, you idiots!

RTL_6_FIGHT1_03 = ~z~Fill him full of holes!

RTL_6_FIGHT1_04 = ~z~Aerate that son of a bitch.

RTL_6_FIGHT1_05 = ~z~Come on!

RTL_6_FIGHT1_06 = ~z~Arms ready!

RTL_6_FIGHT2_01 = ~z~I'm tied! Help me!

RTL_6_FIGHT2_02 = ~z~One of you idiots, cut me loose!

RTL_6_FIGHT2_03 = ~z~Someone do something!

RTL_6_FIGHT2_04 = ~z~He's got me bound over here!

RTL_6_GIVEUP_1 = ~z~Alright, shit, you got me.

RTL_6_GIVEUP_2 = ~z~I'll come with you, you son of a bitch.

RTL_6_QUESM_1 = ~z~Wilson J. McDaniels. I'm going to need you, mister.

RTL_6_QUESM_2 = ~z~I'm taking you alive, whether you like it or not.

RTL_6_QUES_1 = ~z~I'm here for Wilson McDaniels. Don't want anyone else.

RTL_6_THREM_1 = ~z~Wilson J. McDaniels, get your hands up.

RTL_6_THREM_2 = ~z~You ain't gonna die here, mister.

RTL_6_THRE_1 = ~z~I'm here for Wilson McDaniels. Anyone gets in the way, gets a bullet.

RTL_6_WARN2_1 = ~z~Hey! I got someone here!

RTL_6_WARN_1 = ~z~Nuh uh, this place ain't for you. Get!

RTL_GOTSHINE_1 = ~z~So... I got your moonshine.

RTL_RC4_LI_1 = ~z~Ah, hello friend.

RTL_RC4_LI_2 = ~z~Hello Professor... Professor?

RTL_RC4_LI_3 = ~z~Andrew Bell... the Third.

RTL_RC4_LI_4 = ~z~That's it... so,

RTL_RC5_LI_1 = ~z~Here, I got him.

RTL_RC5_LI_2 = ~z~You're wonderful, j-just wonderful.

RTL_RC6_LI_1 = ~z~

RTL_RC_1_1 = ~z~Why, you wanna get overdrunk?

RTL_RC_1_2 = ~z~No, no, it's not for drinking.

RTL_RC_1_3 = ~z~What is it for?

RTL_RC_1_4 = ~z~Oh, I just need some.

RTL_RC_1_5 = ~z~Well, as luck would have it...

RTL_RC_1_6 = ~z~you are in the legal hooch capital of America.

RTL_RC_1_7 = ~z~There's plenty of real booze here.

RTL_RC_1_8 = ~z~But for shine, well...

RTL_RC_1_9 = ~z~I'm guessing you'd need to go out into the woods.

RTL_RC_1_10 = ~z~I mean, I know you'd have to go out into the woods.

RTL_RC_1_11 = ~z~Now listen, I don't need that much.

RTL_RC_1_12 = ~z~How much?

RTL_RC_1_13 = ~z~About a hundred gallons.

RTL_RC_1_14 = ~z~Of shine?

RTL_RC_1_15 = ~z~Yes, thereabouts.

RTL_RC_1_16 = ~z~Why?

RTL_RC_1_17 = ~z~Alright, I'm trying...

RTL_RC_1_18 = ~z~I'm building a machine.

RTL_RC_1_19 = ~z~A machine of love.

RTL_RC_1_20 = ~z~A hundred gallons of hooch...

RTL_RC_1_21 = ~z~and love's gonna come pretty cheap.

RTL_RC_1_22 = ~z~Please, friend.

RTL_RC_1_23 = ~z~I'll pay.

RTL_RC_1_24 = ~z~J-J-Just bring it here.

RTL_RC_1_25 = ~z~It's for a good cause.

RTL_RC_4_1 = ~z~Ah, hello friend.

RTL_RC_4_2 = ~z~Hello, Professor...

RTL_RC_4_3 = ~z~Professor?

RTL_RC_4_4 = ~z~Andrew Bell... the third.

RTL_RC_4_5 = ~z~That's it.

RTL_RC_4_6 = ~z~So, the chief says you can test out your machine.

RTL_RC_4_7 = ~z~Pending the usual formalities.

RTL_RC_4_8 = ~z~And, what are they?

RTL_RC_4_9 = ~z~Finding a suitable... subject.

RTL_RC_4_10 = ~z~Ah, funny you should mention.

RTL_RC_4_11 = ~z~This fellow here...

RTL_RC_4_12 = ~z~he seems sturdy enough, and he's guilty as sin.

RTL_RC_4_13 = ~z~Wilson J. McDaniels.

RTL_RC_4_14 = ~z~Wanted for murder, bigamy and...

RTL_RC_4_15 = ~z~immoral animal husbandry.

RTL_RC_4_16 = ~z~What's that?

RTL_RC_4_17 = ~z~The mind shudders.

RTL_RC_4_18 = ~z~Here, find him for me...

RTL_RC_5_8 = ~z~Yeah, for all the running around I been doing.

RTL_RC_5_9 = ~z~Oh, well...

RTL_RC_5_10 = ~z~once they buy my Humane Electric Ending Facilitator...

RTL_RC_5_11 = ~z~there'll be money enough for you, sir.

RTL_RC_5_12 = ~z~Yeah, let's hope.

RTL_RC_5_13 = ~z~Alright, let's get our...

RTL_RC_5_14 = ~z~our erm...

RTL_RC_5_15 = ~z~our poor unfortunate...

RTL_RC_5_16 = ~z~ready for the demonstration.

RTL_RC_5_17 = ~z~Oh, do come and watch...

RTL_RC_5_18 = ~z~it'll be amazing.

RTL_RC_5_19 = ~z~Come along.

RTL_RC_6_1 = ~z~There, there...

RTL_RC_6_14 = ~z~Somebody shoot me, please...

RTL_RC_6_15 = ~z~Please.

RTL_RC_6_16 = ~z~Huh...

RTL_RC_6_17 = ~z~don't seem overly humane to me.

RTL_RC_6_18 = ~z~I think it's mighty fine.

RTL_S3_EXT_1 = ~z~So...

RTL_S3_EXT_2 = ~z~I got your moonshine!

RTL_S3_EXT_3 = ~z~You're a wonderful man.

RTL_S3_EXT_4 = ~z~Wonderful.

RTL_S3_EXT_5 = ~z~You got my money?

RTL_S3_EXT_7 = ~z~My name is Professor Andrew Bell the third...

RTL_S3_EXT_8 = ~z~perhaps you've heard of me?

RTL_S3_EXT_9 = ~z~Can't say that I have.

RTL_S3_EXT_10 = ~z~I'm an inventor.

RTL_S3_EXT_11 = ~z~Maybe you've...

RTL_S3_EXT_12 = ~z~read about me?

RTL_S3_EXT_13 = ~z~I don't read much.

RTL_S3_EXT_14 = ~z~Oh, oh...

RTL_S3_EXT_15 = ~z~well, that's too bad.

RTL_S3_EXT_16 = ~z~You got my money?
