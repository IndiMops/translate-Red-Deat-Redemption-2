CMLI1_ACTION_1 = ~z~So Arthur... is it true about the bad luck?

CMLI1_ACTION_2 = ~z~What bad luck?

CMLI1_ACTION_3 = ~z~I just broke my pocket mirror and I remember me old ma saying that, a broken mirror means seven years bad luck.

CMLI1_ACTION_4 = ~z~Seven years? But we won't see seven years out! Don't be ridiculous...

CMLI1_ACTION_5 = ~z~but if I find a mirror on my adventures, I'll bring it back for you.

CMLI1_ACTION_6 = ~z~Thank you, Arthur.
