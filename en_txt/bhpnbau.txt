NBX_ECF_Q1J1_1 = ~z~The bounty... why you making this feller someone else's problem?

NBX_ECF_Q1S2_1 = ~z~We, sir, are an urban police force, and the Raiders are, well, mostly a rural nuisance...

NBX_ECF_Q1S2_2 = ~z~my men simply are not suited for this kind of work.

NBX_ECF_Q2A1_1 = ~z~This feller in particular... Wofford, ain't it... why him?

NBX_ECF_Q2A1_2 = ~z~You cut off the head, the body dies... that's the hypothesis, at least.

NBX_ECF_Q2A1_3 = ~z~We shall see if it can be demonstrated with the Lemoyne Raiders.

NBX_ECF_Q2A1_4 = ~z~If the bounty's for this whole outfit, you should have made it more.

NBX_NBS_Q1S2_1 = ~z~That's a mighty forward line of inquiry. The slum dwellers can't be helped, sir. So we're not going to try.

NBX_NBS_Q2J1_1 = ~z~As a matter of fact, I heard about this feller years ago... what more can you tell me of him then?

NBX_NBS_Q2J2_1 = ~z~He's a panderer, a thief, a cheat, a braggart, and somewhat of a hero to a few mistaken fools.

NBX_NBS_Q2J2_2 = ~z~Simply put, the man is bad for society.

NBX_NBS_Q2J2_3 = ~z~Society... well, it's what you make it.

NBX_TAKE_LVE_03 = ~z~May justice be done.

STD_INTR_A_01 = ~z~Well, you're not here to turn yourself in... So I conclude you're a bounty hunter. May I direct you to the poster on the wall there?

STD_INTR_A_02 = ~z~If you're a bounty chaser, take a poster. If you're anything else, take a seat.

STD_INTR_B_01 = ~z~I believe you know where we hang the wanted posters.

STD_INTR_B_02 = ~z~Bounty posters are stuck where they always are, sir.
