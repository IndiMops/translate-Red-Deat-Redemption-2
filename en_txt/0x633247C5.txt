RMNR1_ATTACK_1 = ~z~That's it! Shoot that bastard already!

RMNR1_DISMOUNT_01 = ~z~Dismount, sir, please.

RMNR1_DISMOUNT_02 = ~z~Just leave your horse near mine.

RMNR1_DISMOUNT_03 = ~z~It's best we survey this on foot.

RMNR1_GOODVIEW_1 = ~z~We'll have a good view over the road from this ledge.

RMNR1_GUN1_1 = ~z~Hold it right there!

RMNR1_GUN1_2 = ~z~Whoa, you better put that down right now!

RMNR1_GUN2_1 = ~z~Gonna need your cargo, fellers!

RMNR1_GUN2_2 = ~z~Are you insane? We're the United States Army!

RMNR1_ILO_1 = ~z~Hello... here I am, as promised.

RMNR1_MOUNT_01 = ~z~You'll need your horse.

RMNR1_MOUNT_02 = ~z~Mount up, sir, it'll be a bit of a ride.

RMNR1_MOUNT_03 = ~z~We need to get going, time is not our friend here.

RMNR1_M_MNR_1 = ~z~Okay, I think I know a spot where we should be able to intercept it.

RMNR1_M_MNR_2 = ~z~Lead the way, Captain.

RMNR1_M_MNR_R_01 = ~z~Are you coming, sir?

RMNR1_M_MNR_R_02 = ~z~We should leave now if we're going.

RMNR1_M_MNR_R_03 = ~z~We should hurry.

RMNR1_M_RIDEEND_1 = ~z~Okay, let's dismount here, best leave the horses back a bit.

RMNR1_M_RIDEE_R_01 = ~z~Quick as you can, it will be passing through soon.

RMNR1_M_RIDEE_R_02 = ~z~Come over to the edge here, sir.

RMNR1_M_RIDEE_R_03 = ~z~Mr Morgan, please, I want to show you which way it will be coming.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_1 = ~z~So this Colonel Favours,~rp~ he knows you're up here helping these people?

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_2 = ~z~Yes... and no.~rp~ He knows I'm here to produce a report on the situation.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_3 = ~z~I was sent down from the North after all the news of unrest in the region.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_4 = ~z~But I think my presence might be making things worse.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_5 = ~z~What do you mean?

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_6 = ~z~I worry he's taking some of these actions more to protect himself now.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_7 = ~z~If he can incite more retaliation, maybe he can prove a stronger defense.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_8 = ~z~Like destroying that shrine.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_9 = ~z~Yes, and taking their horses.~rp~ I mean, I don't know if he personally sanctioned any of this or not.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_10 = ~z~This is the other problem,~rp~ there's a culture now in his regiment...~rp~ the rot has traveled down the trunk.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_11 = ~z~Okay,~rp~ well, just show me where to find this wagon, and I'll get the medicine for you.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_01_12 = ~z~You don't need to be involved.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_02_1 = ~z~Alright,~rp~ this is the spot I was thinking of.~rp~ Let's cut up this way.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_02_2 = ~z~Sure.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_02_3 = ~z~There's a nice vantage point up at the top here.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_A1_1 = ~z~Thank you, Mr. Morgan. ~rp~But I must ask you to please be discrete. ~rp~We really cannot afford more conflict.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_A1_2 = ~z~I'm still hoping a meeting can be arranged between Rains Fall and Colonel Favours.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_A2_1 = ~z~Thank you, Mr. Morgan. ~rp~But I must ask you to please be discrete. ~rp~We cannot afford more conflict...

RMNR1_M_RIDE_A2_2 = ~z~especially with Eagle Flies now imprisoned at Fort Wallace.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_A2_3 = ~z~I'm still hoping a meeting can be arranged between Rains Fall and Colonel Favours.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2SHOUTED_2 = ~z~Oh no, no, no, you only need to commandeer the vaccine.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2SPOKEN_2 = ~z~Oh no. No, no, no, you only need to commandeer the vaccine.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_1 = ~z~I understand.~rp~ So I should drop the wagon back at the reservation?

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_3 = ~z~Stealing those and an army wagon will only make matters much worse.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_4 = ~z~Okay.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_5 = ~z~You know,~rp~ Favours has many flaws, but I don't believe he's callous.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_6 = ~z~More an insecure man at the end of his career trying to cling onto something that's already gone.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_7 = ~z~He fought for the Union in the war and his record was considered far from illustrious.

RMNR1_M_RIDE_P2_8 = ~z~A failed man is often the most dangerous...

RMNR1_RSC1_1 = ~z~Captain Monroe.

RMNR1_RSC1_2 = ~z~Of course.

RMNR1_RSC1_3 = ~z~The chief's gone out trying to find medications...

RMNR1_RSC1_4 = ~z~it's quite a business.

RMNR1_RSC1_5 = ~z~Yes.

RMNR1_RSC1_6 = ~z~I thought we were through with all of this.

RMNR1_RSC1_7 = ~z~We are, mostly.

RMNR1_RSC1_8 = ~z~Colonel Favors seems to think the natives have...

RMNR1_RSC1_9 = ~z~broken some promise they never made, and...

RMNR1_RSC1_10 = ~z~apparently he's punishing them by withholding vaccines...

RMNR1_RSC1_11 = ~z~sent down by the Federal Government.

RMNR1_RSC1_12 = ~z~Really?

RMNR1_RSC1_13 = ~z~I was supposed to oversee the administration of vaccines.

RMNR1_RSC1_14 = ~z~Now I hear the wagon's been diverted.

RMNR1_RSC1_15 = ~z~Why would he do such a thing?

RMNR1_RSC1_16 = ~z~To be honest, I truly don't know.

RMNR1_RSC1_17 = ~z~They say he didn't have a very good war, so...

RMNR1_RSC1_18 = ~z~maybe he's trying to start another one.

RMNR1_RSC1_19 = ~z~Is that what you think?

RMNR1_RSC1_20 = ~z~I'm trying to find out...

RMNR1_RSC1_21 = ~z~and he knows I'm trying to find out.

RMNR1_RSC1_22 = ~z~He'd love to provoke me almost as much as...

RMNR1_RSC1_23 = ~z~he'd love to provoke these poor bastards.

RMNR1_RSC1_24 = ~z~Meaning?

RMNR1_RSC1_25 = ~z~Meaning that despite the fact that I think he's a horse's ass...

RMNR1_RSC1_26 = ~z~he knows I think that.

RMNR1_RSC1_27 = ~z~So we're just stuck here trying to make the best of things.

RMNR1_RSC1_28 = ~z~This is the best of things?

RMNR1_RSC1_29 = ~z~Children dying of diseases?

RMNR1_RSC1_30 = ~z~No...

RMNR1_RSC1_31 = ~z~this is awful.

RMNR1_RSC1_32 = ~z~Where is this wagon? Where can we find it?

RMNR1_RSC1_33 = ~z~I can show you...

RMNR1_RSC1_34 = ~z~supposed to be heading to Wapiti...

RMNR1_RSC1_35 = ~z~after coming up through Valentine, but...

RMNR1_RSC1_36 = ~z~it's been diverted south instead.

RMNR1_RSC1_37 = ~z~Come on, Captain Monroe.

RMNR1_RSC1_38 = ~z~M-Mr. Morgan...

RMNR1_RSC1_39 = ~z~we must act with due caution.

RMNR1_RSC1_40 = ~z~Oh, we shall...

RMNR1_RSC1_41 = ~z~we surely shall. Now come.

RMNR1_RSC1_LI_C_1 = ~z~Mr. Morgan!

RMNR1_RSC1_LI_G_1 = ~z~Captain Monroe.

RMNR1_RSC1_LI_G_2 = ~z~Of course.

RMNR1_RSC2_1 = ~z~The wagon should come along this way.

RMNR1_RSC2_2 = ~z~Okay.

RMNR1_RSC2_3 = ~z~You're a good man, Mr. Morgan, but...

RMNR1_RSC2_4 = ~z~I fear this task to be a fool's errand.

RMNR1_RSC2_5 = ~z~Well firstly, I am a long way from a good man...

RMNR1_RSC2_6 = ~z~secondly, fool's errands are my favorite kind of work.

RMNR1_RSC2_7 = ~z~Fair enough. In that case...

RMNR1_RSC2_8 = ~z~I can see we shall be great friends.

RMNR1_RSC2_9 = ~z~May I ask you a question?

RMNR1_RSC2_10 = ~z~Of course.

RMNR1_RSC2_11 = ~z~Why don't you just tell all the folk up in Washington...

RMNR1_RSC2_12 = ~z~what kind of an idiot Colonel Favours is and...

RMNR1_RSC2_13 = ~z~save us all a lot of bother?

RMNR1_RSC2_14 = ~z~Unfortunately the government doesn't work quite like that.

RMNR1_RSC2_15 = ~z~If you say so.

RMNR1_RSC2_16 = ~z~There. I think that's the wagon.

RMNR1_RSC2_17 = ~z~Alright, get yourself outta here.

RMNR1_RSC2_18 = ~z~Just remember to keep it clean. Understand me?

RMNR1_RSC2_19 = ~z~Don't worry, I'm as clean as they come.

RMNR1_RSC2_20 = ~z~Hell, all I do is clean.

RMNR1_RSC2_21 = ~z~Well, good luck.

RMNR1_RSC2_22 = ~z~I'll meet you back at the reservation.

RMNR1_RSC2_23 = ~z~Try not to get yourself killed, Mr. Morgan.

RMNR1_RSC2_24 = ~z~No now that I can't promise.

RMNR1_RSC4_1 = ~z~Captain Monroe...

RMNR1_RSC4_2 = ~z~I got the medicine.

RMNR1_RSC4_3 = ~z~Oh, wonderful. That's great news, Mr. Morgan.

RMNR1_RSC4_4 = ~z~Yeah, well. Don't worry, it... it didn't go too bad.

RMNR1_RSC4_5 = ~z~Well, I'll have to take your word for that.

RMNR1_RSC4_6 = ~z~We could both swing for this.

RMNR1_RSC4_7 = ~z~Yeah, well...

RMNR1_RSC4_8 = ~z~I think I'm a little past caring about hanging, Monroe.

RMNR1_RSC4_9 = ~z~Maybe...

RMNR1_RSC4_10 = ~z~I just hope Colonel Favours thinks he was...

RMNR1_RSC4_11 = ~z~robbed by bandits, and not...

RMNR1_RSC4_12 = ~z~Oh no, I'm still a bandit. There ain't no doubt about that.

RMNR1_RSC4_13 = ~z~Of course.

RMNR1_RSC4_14 = ~z~Well, I better get to work.

RMNR1_RSC4_15 = ~z~Thank you, Mr. Morgan.

RMNR1_RSC4_16 = ~z~Bandit or not, this was a good thing.

RMNR1_RSC4_17 = ~z~Maybe it'll get us both killed, but it had to be done.

RMNR1_RSC4_18 = ~z~I hope so.

RMNR1_RSC4_LI_1 = ~z~Captain Monroe...

RMNR1_RSC4_LI_2 = ~z~I've got the medicine.

RMNR1_TRN3_1 = ~z~You see that?~rp~ Somebody blew up the bridge.

RMNR1_TRN3_2 = ~z~Damn.

RMNR1_TRN3_3 = ~z~I've no idea why, but it certainly hasn't helped to dampen the Colonel's ire.

RMNR1_TRN3_4 = ~z~I assured him this wasn't the work of the Indians, but I fear my protests fell on deaf ears.

RMNR1_WARNB_1_01 = ~z~I said get away!

RMNR1_WARNB_1_02 = ~z~Are you hearing me?

RMNR1_WARNB_2_01 = ~z~Do you want to get shot, is that it?

RMNR1_WARNB_2_02 = ~z~We'll open fire if we have to!

RMNR1_WARN_01_01 = ~z~Hey, you don't get too close to this wagon!

RMNR1_WARN_01_02 = ~z~Hey, you, keep your distance!

RMNR1_WARN_02_01 = ~z~Either fall back or move on!

RMNR1_WARN_02_02 = ~z~What do you want? Get out of here!
