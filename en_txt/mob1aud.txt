MOB1_CRWD4_2 = ~z~Since when?

MOB1_CRWD4_3 = ~z~Since forever. I read it in the newspaper.

MOB1_CRWD4_4 = ~z~Oh so it must be true. So they tell you your dog's a cat now, you just start calling him Mittens?

MOB1_GRP3_2 = ~z~So you just walk up to any man with a ring on his finger and turn it three times?

MOB1_GRP3_3 = ~z~Yes... then after twenty-four men, find any married person, male or female, wearing a wedding ring...

MOB1_GRP3_4 = ~z~turn that ring twice, and then the next man you shake hands with will become your husband.
