MPINTRO_MCS1_7 = ~z~Jessica LeClerk, how do you do?

MPINTRO_MCS1_8 = ~z~What did you tell her?

MPINTRO_MCS1_9 = ~z~Nothing. As we discussed.

MPINTRO_MCS1_10 = ~z~Thank you, Horley.

MPINTRO_MCS1_11 = ~z~I do hope we haven't inconvenienced you dreadfully...

MPINTRO_MCS1_12 = ~z~but seeing as you were due to be hanged in a week...

MPINTRO_MCS1_13 = ~z~I'm sure you don't object too strongly.

MPINTRO_MCS1_14 = ~z~I know you're innocent...

MPINTRO_MCS1_15 = ~z~well, not perhaps exactly innocent...

MPINTRO_MCS1_16 = ~z~but not guilty of what you were accused.

MPINTRO_MCS1_17 = ~z~I know you and those who were with you that died...

MPINTRO_MCS1_18 = ~z~were little more than patsies...

MPINTRO_MCS1_19 = ~z~and that you were set up by one of three men, or a woman...

MPINTRO_MCS1_20 = ~z~possibly by all of them.

MPINTRO_MCS1_21 = ~z~I can't be sure...

MPINTRO_MCS1_22 = ~z~but that is all I know so far.

MPINTRO_MCS1_23 = ~z~And one of these people also made Mrs. LeClerk a widow.

MPINTRO_MCS1_24 = ~z~And I will avenge my husband's death...

MPINTRO_MCS1_25 = ~z~so help me God.

MPINTRO_MCS1_26 = ~z~But I will not avenge it upon them who did not cause it...

MPINTRO_MCS1_27 = ~z~or caused it unwillingly.

MPINTRO_MCS1_28 = ~z~Anyway, I'm sure this is all a touch confusing and melodramatic.

MPINTRO_MCS1_29 = ~z~Uh, where are my manners?

MPINTRO_MCS1_30 = ~z~Horley, please show our guest to their tent and...

MPINTRO_MCS1_31 = ~z~give them some fresh clothes to put on.

MPINTRO_MCS2_1 = ~z~That looks more comfortable.

MPINTRO_MCS2_2 = ~z~Horley...

MPINTRO_MCS2_3 = ~z~Here, madam.

MPINTRO_MCS2_11 = ~z~You're the only person I could possibly trust...

MPINTRO_MCS2_12 = ~z~to do whatever it takes.

MPINTRO_MCS2_13 = ~z~Because you and your accomplices...

MPINTRO_MCS2_14 = ~z~you're the only other victims of their lies still alive.

MPINTRO_MCS2_15 = ~z~You see...

MPINTRO_MCS2_16 = ~z~you walked into the town at approximately...

MPINTRO_MCS2_17 = ~z~the same time my husband was shot in the back...

MPINTRO_MCS2_18 = ~z~but by another gun.

MPINTRO_MCS2_19 = ~z~Firing different bullets to those you possessed...

MPINTRO_MCS2_20 = ~z~when you were arrested.

MPINTRO_MCS2_21 = ~z~These bullets.

MPINTRO_MCS2_22 = ~z~This was their mistake.

MPINTRO_MCS2_23 = ~z~You were rounded up and sentenced to death...

MPINTRO_MCS2_24 = ~z~all because you came to town and didn't talk too much...

MPINTRO_MCS2_25 = ~z~and seemed like you were nasty.
