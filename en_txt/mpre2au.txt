MPRE2_CHASEJ_6 = ~z~Make your choices, quick.

MPRE2_COMBAT_1 = ~z~Get them all.

MPRE2_DRIVE_1 = ~z~I do confess, this is a most strange appointment.

MPRE2_DRIVE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Like I said, ~rp~I would be much more comfortable~sl:~going as your emissary, ma'am.

MPRE2_DRIVE_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~And I said I wanted to hear what he had to say... ~rp~and to~sl:~look him in the eye when he was saying it.

MPRE2_DRIVE_4 = ~z~Is that all you want?

MPRE2_DRIVE_5 = ~z~Let's just see.

MPRE2_DRIVE_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~When we get there, you decent folk can stay by my side.~sl:0.2:1.5~~rp~Or you can look over the meeting~sl:~from some vantage point.

MPRE2_DRIVE_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~Remember, this is not just the man who killed my husband.~sl:0.2~~rp~He, his wife, and Jeremiah Shaw...

MPRE2_DRIVE_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~all had a hand in putting you away.~sl:0.3~~rp~And setting you up for the gallows, too.

MPRE2_DRIVE_9 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~With that in mind...~sl:0.3~~rp~I hope you trust me to act in all our interests here.

MPRE2_DRIVE_10 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Think of your self-interest too, ma'am.~sl:0.3:1.1~~rp~Your safety.~sl:0.5~~rp~I'm sure we're all concerned with that.

MPRE2_DRIVE_11 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Oh, Mr. Horley. I'll be fine. ~rp~We all shall.~sl:0.9~~rp~It's them who won't, should things head that way.

MPRE2_DROPOFF2_1 = ~z~Up there. Stop the wagon just ahead.

MPRE2_DROPOFF_1 = ~z~We should look for somewhere to stop.

MPRE2_EXT_1 = ~z~This is a good spot, pull up.

MPRE2_EXT_2 = ~z~I'll take it from here.

MPRE2_EXT_3 = ~z~Here are the documents, madam.

MPRE2_EXT_4 = ~z~They were forged.

MPRE2_EXT_5 = ~z~Of course they were forged.

MPRE2_EXT_6 = ~z~Here.

MPRE2_EXT_7 = ~z~I don't need to see them.

MPRE2_EXT_8 = ~z~No, I don't suppose you do.

MPRE2_EXT_9 = ~z~Although there's uh...

MPRE2_EXT_10 = ~z~There's Grace Lancing, but she will have to wait.

MPRE2_EXT_11 = ~z~And also, we have to decide how we're...

MPRE2_EXT_12 = ~z~gonna clear all our names and...

MPRE2_EXT_13 = ~z~extricate ourselves from the mess we have uncovered.

MPRE2_EXT_14 = ~z~I'm not sure the state authorities take too...

MPRE2_EXT_15 = ~z~kindly to revenge killings, madam.

MPRE2_EXT_16 = ~z~No, I'm sure they don't.

MPRE2_EXT_17 = ~z~But that's a problem for another day.

MPRE2_EXT_18 = ~z~Because right now, their little plot is over...

MPRE2_EXT_19 = ~z~and my husband has been avenged.

MPRE2_EXT_20 = ~z~My friends, my true friends.

MPRE2_EXT_21 = ~z~I owe you more than words can say.

MPRE2_EXT_22 = ~z~Thank you.

MPRE2_EXT_23 = ~z~And should our paths cross again and...

MPRE2_EXT_24 = ~z~well, I'm sure they may.

MPRE2_EXT_25 = ~z~But right now, I need to make myself scarce.

MPRE2_EXT_26 = ~z~And I recommend that you all do your best not to get...

MPRE2_EXT_27 = ~z~into too much additional trouble.

MPRE2_EXT_28 = ~z~That's your business.

MPRE2_EXT_29 = ~z~My poor husband...

MPRE2_EXT_30 = ~z~he deserved so much better than this...

MPRE2_EXT_31 = ~z~but this is what he got.

MPRE2_EXT_32 = ~z~This is what we all got.

MPRE2_EXT_33 = ~z~Drive on, Mr. Horley.

MPRE2_FLEEBANT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Stay down, ma'am. We're not out of this yet.~sl:0.1~~rp~Shoot them when you see 'em!

MPRE2_FLEEBANT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~Amos Lancing's dead...~sl:0.2:~so, these men are working for someone.

MPRE2_FLEEBANT_3 = ~z~He may be dead, but his money isn't. ~rp~Stay down, my lady.

MPRE2_FLEEBANT_4 = ~z~I'm down, alright. ~rp~Be careful, Horley.

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_2 = ~z~In the middle of town... of course... very good, Mr. Lancing.

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Tells everyone he's the boss now.~sl:0.7~Keeps me from acting too crazy.

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~You can hide up on the roofs or stay down here...~sl:~just make sure we don't get killed.

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_5 = ~z~~sl:0.2~Just make sure if we do get killed, everyone dies.

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_6 = ~z~~sl:0.1~No... just make sure we aren't both killed...

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_7 = ~z~Come along, Mr. Horley.

MPRE2_IG1_WNT_8 = ~z~Good luck... and thank you.

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_1 = ~z~Nothing whatsoever... he... he was blackmailing me, Mr. Lancing was.

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_2 = ~z~I always knew you were a low life, Mr. Shaw.

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_3 = ~z~Yeah, but not a murderer.

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_4 = ~z~I don't know about that... give me the papers.

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_5 = ~z~

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_6 = ~z~Forged.

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_8 = ~z~Get the hell out of my sight, you pathetic lowlife...

MPRE2_IG4_PAPER_9 = ~z~Alright... better go rescue Mrs. LeClerk.

MPRE2_INT_1 = ~z~I'm so glad you came.

MPRE2_INT_2 = ~z~Thank you.

MPRE2_INT_3 = ~z~It seems your efforts have not been entirely in vain...

MPRE2_INT_4 = ~z~but, have produced some rather surprising results.

MPRE2_INT_5 = ~z~Well, not surprising...

MPRE2_INT_6 = ~z~Confusing.

MPRE2_INT_7 = ~z~Confusing...

MPRE2_INT_8 = ~z~after castigating me as a...

MPRE2_INT_9 = ~z~a widow, a harlot, a fool, a mad woman.

MPRE2_INT_10 = ~z~Anything and everything.

MPRE2_INT_11 = ~z~Suddenly, shortly after we killed his brother-in-law...

MPRE2_INT_12 = ~z~Amos Lancing wants to talk.

MPRE2_INT_13 = ~z~He sent word via an intermediary.

MPRE2_INT_14 = ~z~Mr. Jones...

MPRE2_INT_15 = ~z~Even that crazy old fool said not to trust any of it.

MPRE2_INT_16 = ~z~Which is why we need you.

MPRE2_INT_17 = ~z~You're to help keep Mrs. LeClerk protected...

MPRE2_INT_18 = ~z~during the meeting at Blackwater.

MPRE2_INT_19 = ~z~I shouldn't imagine they would kill us in broad day light, but...

MPRE2_INT_20 = ~z~you never know.

MPRE2_INT_21 = ~z~I never imagined they'd kill my husband...

MPRE2_INT_22 = ~z~nor turn me into a fugitive.

MPRE2_INT_23 = ~z~Anyway, friends...

MPRE2_INT_24 = ~z~shall we go?

MPRE2_INT_25 = ~z~Today may go any number of ways...

MPRE2_INT_26 = ~z~but I wanna make sure once the shooting starts...

MPRE2_INT_27 = ~z~all of them end up dead.

MPRE2_INT_28 = ~z~One of you drive the wagon, the other keep guard.

MPRE2_INT_29 = ~z~Thank you.

MPRE2_INT_30 = ~z~All of you.

MPRE2_INT_31 = ~z~This means...

MPRE2_INT_32 = ~z~well, it means something.

MPRE2_INT_33 = ~z~I don't know exactly what yet, but...

MPRE2_INT_34 = ~z~I don't think any of us think Mr. Lancing has become a saint, madam...

MPRE2_INT_35 = ~z~but uh, perhaps we should hear him out.

MPRE2_INT_36 = ~z~Perhaps.

MPRE2_JBLOCK_1 = ~z~They're blocking this way.

MPRE2_JCOMBAT_01 = ~z~All Lancing's men are killers.

MPRE2_WAGBANT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~That he did, ma'am.~sl:0.7:2.0~~rp~But I think we would all have liked to know~sl:~you were going to shoot him before hand... ma'am.

MPRE2_WAGBANT_4 = ~z~I didn't know it myself, until the moment it was done.

MPRE2_WAGBANT_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~What a fool Amos was.~sl:0.2:2.6~~rp~A man's presumptions about women...~sl:0.5~~rp~they can be their undoing, Horley.
