1049_END_DAY_1 = ~z~Well, anyways, I should be getting things fixed up around here.

1049_INTRO_1 = ~z~Nothing like a good fire under the sky, is there?

1049_INTRO_2 = ~z~Probably ain't used to finding a woman out here by herself...

1049_INT_NEG_A_1 = ~z~I've seen just about everything out here.

1049_INT_NEG_J_1 = ~z~I've seen just about everything out here.

1049_INT_POS_A_1 = ~z~Guess so.

1049_INT_POS_J_1 = ~z~Guess so.

1049_STORY_P1_1 = ~z~Well, believe me, I ain't scared of much...

1049_STORY_P1_2 = ~z~I can shoot, drink, ride and spit good as any man.

1049_STORY_P1_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~Maybe not as good as one woman I know, though.~sl:0.2~Goes by the name of Black Belle.

1049_STORY_P1_4 = ~z~Like I said, I ain't scared of much, but if she were mad at me? I'd be scared of her.

1049_STORY_P1_5 = ~z~Possibly the best gun in the whole west.

1049_STORY_P1_6 = ~z~Got a price on her head bigger than Landon Ricketts... been on the run for twenty years or more now.

1049_STORY_P1_7 = ~z~Killed more men than cholera and heartbreak combined.

1049_STORY_P1_N_1 = ~z~Yeah, well I'd like to see you square up to her!

1049_STORY_P1_P_1 = ~z~~sl:0.3:0.0~So you heard of her too, huh?

1049_STORY_P2_1 = ~z~Well, I first met her in Tucson. We drank for two days straight.

1049_STORY_P2_2 = ~z~She told me one time she'd be staying in this cabin for a few weeks, when she woke up to shouts outside...

1049_STORY_P2_3 = ~z~four bounty hunters, nasty ones.

1049_STORY_P2_4 = ~z~So she calls back:

1049_STORY_P2_5 = ~z~“I ain't coming for you pathetic sons of bitches!" Tells 'em to send some real men, instead of little boys,

1049_STORY_P2_6 = ~z~and quickly ducks down into the cellar.

1049_STORY_P2_7 = ~z~Of course, they start shooting the hell out of the place.

1049_STORY_P2_8 = ~z~And every now and again she yells back at them and they can't work out how these bullets ain't hitting...

1049_STORY_P2_9 = ~z~this ain't much more than a one room shack.

1049_STORY_P2_N_1 = ~z~What, you don't believe me? Just cause she's a woman?

1049_STORY_P2_P_1 = ~z~Quick thinking, right?

1049_STORY_P3_1 = ~z~So in the end, they kick in what's left of the door and barely have time to say:

1049_STORY_P3_2 = ~z~“Where the hell is she?”

1049_STORY_P3_3 = ~z~Before bang, bang, bang, bang!

1049_STORY_P3_4 = ~z~Four shots from under the floorboards and they're all dead on the ground.

1049_STORY_P3_5 = ~z~Apparently, she lined up all the bodies and nailed her bounty poster to one of their heads.

1049_STORY_P3_N_1 = ~z~Alright, I'm done then, if you're gonna act like that...

1049_STORY_P3_N_2 = ~z~I ain't got time for men like you.

1049_STORY_P4_1 = ~z~These days, she's almost a celebrity, even seen her picture on a cigarette card.

1049_STORY_P4_2 = ~z~Strange how that works... for the longest time they revile you...

1049_STORY_P4_3 = ~z~but if you're bad enough, and survive long enough, they start to revere you.

1049_STORY_P4_4 = ~z~Guess that's America.
