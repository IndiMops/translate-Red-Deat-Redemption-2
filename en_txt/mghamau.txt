MGHAM_HAN_INT_5 = ~z~well...

MGHAM_HAN_INT_6 = ~z~some old stories.

MGHAM_HAN_INT_7 = ~z~And those ain't to everyone's taste neither.

MGHAM_HAN_INT_8 = ~z~You know folks like to come out here, lend a hand time to time.

MGHAM_HAN_INT_9 = ~z~And I'll pay 'em for it when I can.

MGHAM_HAN_INT_10 = ~z~You see this old leg here, uh, well...

MGHAM_HAN_INT_11 = ~z~To be more precise, the lacking of it...

MGHAM_HAN_INT_12 = ~z~prevents me from taking care of things the way I like to.

MGHAM_HAN_INT_13 = ~z~So, what do you say?

MGHAM_HAN_INT_14 = ~z~You wanna help an old man out with what's vexing him?

MGHAM_JB_DEC_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1:1~Alright then...

MGHAM_JB_GEN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~Well, then. No sense hanging around here,~sl:0.0:2.0~listening to an old man chew cud.~sl:1.8~I got it all written down for you.

MGHAM_JB_GEN_2 = ~z~If you can handle this, I'll make it good.

MGHAM_JB_OTH_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Alright. This is embarrassing.~sl:1.4:2.4~If I can't deal with a bear, you might ask,~sl:~what business do I have living out here in the wild?

MGHAM_JB_OTH_2 = ~z~And you'd be right to put that question to me.

MGHAM_JB_OTH_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~No, I ain't never claimed to be no smart man,~sl:0.0:1.7~so excuse me if I ain't clever enough~sl:~to figure out when this place has got me beat.

MGHAM_JB_OTH_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~So if you just... help me with the grizzly,~sl:0.0:2.8~so I can keep on living out here until some even bigger beast~sl:~comes along and proves to be my better.

MGHAM_JB_OTH_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~You'll find it up near Cotorra Springs.~sl:0.3~And get a trophy off of it for me.

MGHAM_JB_OTH_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.6~Good luck.~sl:0.9~Thanks.

MGHAM_JB_REPO_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Good. 'Cause time is of the essence here.~sl:0.6~A supply train to some settlers' camp's been highjacked.

MGHAM_JB_REPO_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~It's hard enough living off your wits out here against the elements.~sl:0.2~You don't need this kind of misfortune befalling you as well.

MGHAM_JB_REPO_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Nope, you do not.~sl:0.9:3.4~They should be 'round about Bacchus Bridge, these bastards...~sl:~get them wagons back off them, quick as you can.

MGHAM_JB_REPO_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~I'll make it right with you if you do,~sl:0.5~and you'll be doing a good thing for some poor people.

MGHAM_JB_REPO_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~You're in my prayers.~sl:1.0~Go, quick now.

MGHAM_JB_VIP_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Well, alright then. Hoped you'd be good for it.~sl:1.7~This party come through here the other day.

MGHAM_JB_VIP_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Now, I warned them there were certain...~sl:0.5~elements about Skinner Brothers, but...

MGHAM_JB_VIP_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~they kept going anyway and, you guessed it.~sl:0.6~They never came back.

MGHAM_JB_VIP_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Now, folks that know think~sl:0.0:2.8~they might be up near Moonstone Pond.~sl:0.2~Who can tell if they're alive? More likely... not.

MGHAM_JB_VIP_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~But if they are, it's your job to go get 'em.~sl:1.6:2.5~Ah, they been belligerent, alright, but..~sl:0.3~ they oughtn't to die for that.

MGHAM_JB_VIP_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~You look after yourself too, while you're at it.~sl:1.0~Be safe. Good luck.

MGHAM_LEAVEN_01 = ~z~If that's it, so long.

MGHAM_LEAVEN_02 = ~z~Bye now.

MGHAM_LEAVEN_03 = ~z~Don't want to keep you any longer.

MGHAM_LEAVEN_04 = ~z~This has been nice, huh?

MGHAM_LEAVEN_05 = ~z~Well, good to see ya.

MGHAM_OH_CFOR_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Now, how about this then?~sl:0.5~Here I am, a hunter of game, for food and the sport of it...

MGHAM_OH_CFOR_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~who's never approved of hunting for profit,~sl:0.2:2.4:1~asking you to do that very thing.

MGHAM_OH_CFOR_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~There is a bear, lives below Fort Wallace, and he's, eh...~sl:~made quite a nuisance of himself of late.

MGHAM_OH_CFOR_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~I know I harp on about it,~sl:0.0:2.5~but my leg is playing up something terrible...~sl:0.2~if it weren't, I'd be after him myself.

MGHAM_OH_CFOR_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Would you take care of him before anyone comes to harm?~sl:0.2~As I said, you will profit from this hunting.

MGHAM_OH_CFOR_6 = ~z~You just take a trophy, alright? He sure is something.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRA_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Alright. Need to see if you can find a cart.~sl:0.4~Driver got lost in the hills and had to abandon it.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRA_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~We found him, cold and hungry, but we couldn't find the cart.~sl:0.4~From the tracks, I'd say the Murfrees might've taken it.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRA_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.1~You know them, right?~sl:0.7:2.5~Don't think they'll be too far, probably a~sl:~band of 'em camping somewhere up in Cumberland Forest.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRA_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Poor feller has everything he owns in that cart,~sl:0.4~so get it back and he'll reward you.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRA_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3~Do your best by him.~sl:0.9~I'm sure you will.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Okay. This one ain't gonna end happy.~sl:0.4~From what I hear, the poor feller's dead already.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRB_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~There's Murfrees, see, on the track up to the east of here.~sl:0.3:3.8~This cart driver didn't think to check on the safety of the roads.~sl:0.2~Rode right into 'em.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Let's get his cart back, return it to the family...~sl:0.3~these murderous bastards shouldn't have no right to it.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRB_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Of course there'll be some reward for your retrieval of it,~sl:0.2~but that's the right thing to do.

MGHAM_RE_ECFRB_5 = ~z~There's no sense in any of this. None at all.

MGHAM_RW_BHOL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Right. This'll take some grit.~sl:0.7:2.6~Another supply wagon's been waylaid,~sl:~this time by them unfortunates at Beaver Hollow.

MGHAM_RW_BHOL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~So again, I'll ask you to retrieve it.~sl:0.7:2.3~We know the Murfrees done worse~sl:~than kill in robberies before...

MGHAM_RW_BHOL_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~but no one was harmed when the wagon was taken...~sl:0.4~so I would hope no life will be lost if it is retrieved.

MGHAM_RW_BHOL_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~I'm a sensitive and sentimental old man, indulge me if you can.~sl:0.2~And if you can't, so be it.

MGHAM_RW_BHOL_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~The wagon should be at their cave, there.~sl:0.7~An unfortunate bunch. That's what they are.

MGHAM_RW_ECFR_1 = ~z~Well. We lost a wagon. Seem to have trouble keeping hold of 'em...

MGHAM_RW_ECFR_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Maybe 'cause the only thing worth taking up here is supplies.~sl:0.2~There ain't a bank to rob in miles.

MGHAM_RW_ECFR_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~I'd rather be stuck in a room full of canned goods~sl:~than a room full of cash when the weather comes in, wouldn't you?

MGHAM_RW_ECFR_4 = ~z~~sl:0.2:0.9~Maybe not...~sl:0.5:1.8~but you'll be treated like you're driving~sl:0.0:2.1~an express coach full of gold,~sl:0.0:2.3~if you get that supply wagon back to us,~sl:~I promise you will.

MGHAM_RW_ECFR_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Should be up on Roanoake Ridge.~sl:0.4:3.1~But it ain't worth dying for, nor killing neither.~sl:0.3:0.8~You hear?~sl:0.7~Good luck.

MGHAM_RW_EGRZ_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Okay. Good to have you on board.~sl:0.6:3.7~A wagon's gone missing, and I got a good idea~sl:~it was taken by some boys been camping up here.

MGHAM_RW_EGRZ_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Fools don't know what they gotten into.~sl:0.7:2.4~These fellers aren't choir boys, but...~sl:~they ain't bad, exactly, either...

MGHAM_RW_EGRZ_3 = ~z~I just know if the wrong people go after it, it'll only go one way.

MGHAM_RW_EGRZ_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~You think you could try and retrieve it~sl:~before the whole thing gets outta hand?

MGHAM_RW_EGRZ_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Might not be possible, but I'd be grateful if you tried.~sl:0.5~They're somewhere east of Wapiti.

MGHAM_RW_EGRZ_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~The wagon is all I'm looking for.~sl:0.5~They're just boys. Thank you.

MGHAM_SB_BCS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.8~Fine.~sl:0.8:1.9~I ever told you about my fishing?~sl:0.5~I could bore you into an early grave with my angling tales.

MGHAM_SB_BCS_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~That's the thing about fishing, or hunting, or anything else.~sl:0.4~Do it as much as you like, just don't talk about it. It's boring.

MGHAM_SB_BCS_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~Now, the reason I tell you about my fishing is...~sl:0.2~the creek down there's been taken over.

MGHAM_SB_BCS_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Murfrees Brood destroying the reed beds,~sl:~turning everything to silt, spoiling the habitat.

MGHAM_SB_BCS_5 = ~z~So get their boats, won't ya? Down the Kamassa.

MGHAM_SB_RRN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Okay, then. You can put this right.~sl:1.3:2.7~There's a group of fools on the Kamassa...~sl:0.5~been going up and down in boats...

MGHAM_SB_RRN_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~causing trouble to all good and peaceable folk.~sl:0.5~The best way to stop 'em, I believe, is to seize their vessels.
