PKR_JOHN_CONV1_1 = ~z~Why don't we up the ante here? Loser has to strip and jump in the water?

PKR_JOHN_CONV1_2 = ~z~Oh wait, Marston can't swim.

PKR_JOHN_CONV1_3 = ~z~I have no intention of losing anyway.

PKR_JOHN_CONV1_4 = ~z~Nobody can say you suffer a crisis of confidence, John.

PKR_JOHN_CONV2_1 = ~z~So Marston, what's this I hear about you wanting to be a rancher one day?

PKR_JOHN_CONV2_2 = ~z~That's Abigail's dream, not mine. But maybe. We're supposed to be retiring, ain't we?

PKR_JOHN_CONV2_3 = ~z~But you can't herd cattle for love, nor money.

PKR_JOHN_CONV2_4 = ~z~Well I'll learn.

PKR_JOHN_CONV2_5 = ~z~I'd like to see that...

PKR_LEN_CONV1_1 = ~z~Nobody can say I've had a misspent youth.

PKR_LEN_CONV1_2 = ~z~Poker builds character, as the saying goes.

PKR_LEN_CONV1_3 = ~z~Who said that?

PKR_LEN_CONV1_4 = ~z~I think Davey Callander did.

PKR_LEN_CONV1_5 = ~z~Well, we can't speak ill of the dead.

PKR_PRS_CONV1_1 = ~z~By the way, has anybody seen my compass?

PKR_PRS_CONV1_2 = ~z~I ain't. I didn't know you had one.

PKR_PRS_CONV1_3 = ~z~Yes, I had that since my first day in the navy. Can't believe I've gone and lost it.

PKR_PRS_CONV1_4 = ~z~Well I'll keep my eye out for another one.

PKR_PRS_CONV1_5 = ~z~Thank you, Mr. Morgan. The amount we move around, it's a useful thing to have.

PKR_REV1_CONV1_1 = ~z~Let's see if you can stay awake for this, Reverend.

PKR_REV1_CONV1_2 = ~z~I'm fine, Mr. Morgan. Though I could beat you with my eyes closed.

PKR_REV1_CONV1_3 = ~z~We'll see about that.

PKR_REV1_CONV2_1 = ~z~I wish Davey was still here... nobody loved a game of cards more than him.

PKR_REV1_CONV2_2 = ~z~An incorrigible reprobate, but always good company.

PKR_REV1_CONV2_3 = ~z~Sure he'd say the same about you... well, maybe not the good company part.

PKR_REV1_CONV2_4 = ~z~Humor has unfortunately forsaken you, my child.

PKR_REV1_CONV2_5 = ~z~Let's hope Luck hasn't done the same.

PKR_STR_CONV1_1 = ~z~I also feel like the odds are especially stacked against me when I play with you, Strauss.

PKR_STR_CONV1_2 = ~z~It is a game of pure chance, Mr Morgan.

PKR_STR_CONV1_3 = ~z~Yeah, I bet you can name the last twenty cards.

PKR_STR_CONV1_4 = ~z~Well, of course, you have to pay some attention...

PKR_STR_CONV2_1 = ~z~You know, Strauss, I think you're tougher than you look.

PKR_STR_CONV2_2 = ~z~I'll try to take that as a compliment.

PKR_STR_CONV2_3 = ~z~I wasn't raised by outlaws but life wasn't easy for me growing up.

PKR_STR_CONV2_4 = ~z~Robbing, robbing and selling, robbing and selling back to where it came from.

PKR_STR_CONV2_5 = ~z~The young Austrian hustler.

PKR_STR_CONV2_6 = ~z~I was pretty good at it.

PKR_STR_CONV2_7 = ~z~I've no doubt.

PKR_SUS_CONV1_1 = ~z~Remember the old days, Arthur? Me, you, Hosea, Dutch playing poker 'til all hours...

PKR_SUS_CONV1_2 = ~z~You on Dutch's knee most of the time, from what I remember.

PKR_SUS_CONV1_3 = ~z~Probably. Though mostly just so he could see my cards, I'm sure.

PKR_SUS_CONV1_4 = ~z~Long time ago now.

PKR_SUS_CONV2_1 = ~z~Remember that feller you caught cheating in that bar in Fort Collins, Miss Grimshaw?

PKR_SUS_CONV2_2 = ~z~Why do you always bring this up?

PKR_SUS_CONV2_3 = ~z~Never seen you so mad. I doubt he fathered any children again.

PKR_SUS_CONV2_4 = ~z~I was doing the world a favor.
