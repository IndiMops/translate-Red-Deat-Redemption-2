0x008F2CF1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:6.9~But Biscuit? He was a fine animal. Loyal. Smart. Brave.~sl:0.4~Didn't take no guff, not from no one.

0x034BC7A8 = ~z~Alright then. Guess I'll walk from here...

0x0884E68E = ~z~You are a good sort.

0x09BC6A45 = ~z~I was saying something... Oh right, yeah.

0x0DB85FCD = ~z~Think you might've got twisted around.

0x0DD5A743 = ~z~I really owe you one.

0x0F884ED3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~My horse up and died on me, twisted my ankle something fierce.~sl:0.2~Think you could give me a ride?

0x1B07D9FD = ~z~Will you quit it already?

0x1CBFAC5E = ~z~You some kind of stupid? Leave me alone, damn you! Leave me alone!

0x2CA78377 = ~z~I love the bastard, but he's too proud to admit how bad things really are...

0x3A95CA86 = ~z~What is wrong with you?

0x3BBE46AC = ~z~Won't you leave me be?

0x3BEE4009 = ~z~You mind? You're real close.

0x3DE984BC = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.4~This was kind of you, mister.~sl:0.4~Please, take this as my way of thanking you.

0x4E6F67F9 = ~z~That's it! Let me off if you keep taking me who knows where...

0x4F4835D8 = ~z~Wait, wait, don't leave me here!

0x5DBCFD29 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~Glad I ran into you... I raised that horse, you know?~sl:0.3~Raised it since it was just a foal.

0x6E018777 = ~z~Please, please... It's really not far.

0x7E6B5052 = ~z~Come on, now ain't the time for hunting!

0x8C1922C6 = ~z~~sl:0.3:3.5~Well, appreciate the ride and all, but that's awful rude.~sl:0.7~I think I'll say goodbye to you, then.

0x8E414686 = ~z~What's wrong with you?

0x8FF0D2AC = ~z~Listen, please... take this. For what it's worth, I hope it helps with your ailings.

0x9AFE6708 = ~z~I don't want you to work in that mine no more, okay?

0x9F126D78 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~Well, go on then!~sl:1.0:2.2~See if I care whether you come back...

0x23C1A57A = ~z~You aiming to knock me off?

0x36E35A44 = ~z~Come on. I'm sure you're well enough.

0x37F92462 = ~z~Come on, get moving!

0x40EDDF0A = ~z~Is there a man in this town who ain't a moron?

0x41B15FA7 = ~z~~sl:0.7:1.0~Well, excuse me!

0x50EC3F1F = ~z~It takes a lowdown son of a bitch to treat a person like this! You can go to hell!

0x51D70CDD = ~z~~sl:1.0:0.9~I gotta stay busy.~sl:2.0:1.0~It's the only way.

0x52D0C132 = ~z~What route is this? It's taking a mighty long time.

0x65FDA742 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.6~Yeah, had a good laugh on that one. I tell the husband, what does he do?~sl:0.2~"Should've never gone over there, Honey," he says. Gee, thanks...

0x81BE4247 = ~z~What did I do to deserve this?

0x84B05FA1 = ~z~You know, maybe I'll pass. You go take care of yourself.

0x94D32802 = ~z~Thanks again.

0x96D1B762 = ~z~Is that a threat? You get the hell away from me!

0x296A7D64 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.5~Yeah. That horse did right by me. Better than my husband, truth be told.~sl:0.4~That fool, always complaining, but does he do something about it?

0x335BF71D = ~z~If you ain't gonna help me then leave me be.

0x364BF3F4 = ~z~You're a killer! Let me off, let me off!

0x394BB204 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~Well, he gets wheezing on and I must've made some sort of noise,~sl:0.2:4.6~because the next thing I know Biscuit had nipped his ear clean off!~sl:0.4:3.2~Kicked his hide, too, as he was hollering away.~sl:~Didn't think a man could run so fast.

0x485DAD0A = ~z~Here we go. This is great.

0x752DE715 = ~z~We gonna move at some point? Or is this it?

0x817A0371 = ~z~~sl:0.1:1.6~You never listen to me.~sl:0.8:2.0~It's like talking to a goddamn wall.

0x891EBF50 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Well you can't provide for us if you ain't got no lungs!~sl:1.0:1.5~And what if it caves in again?

0x6675DAC1 = ~z~Just leave me alone, please.

0x9039E437 = ~z~A good job? Caking your lungs for a couple of dollars a week? Scared or not, he's gonna ruin us both...

0x9056E060 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.9~That idiot.~sl:1.2:1.4~I love him and I hate him...~sl:1.4:3.0~Every day, covered in soot, coughing half the night...

0x9877FB53 = ~z~Wait! Emerald Ranch is the other way!

0x16041CFD = ~z~~sl:0.5~What a lousy day...

0x24469C92 = ~z~What is the matter with you?

0x36431F66 = ~z~

0x53132DC9 = ~z~You know Emerald Ranch? Mind taking me there?

0x458364D5 = ~z~Come on, please. It won't take long.

0x20549604 = ~z~Why are you behaving like this?

0x36373592 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6~For the time being...~sl:0.4:3.9~I was looking for work, they was looking for some help with the gardens.~sl:0.5:3.1~If I waited any longer for my husband to put food on the table,~sl:~I'd have died of starvation.

0x52087815 = ~z~You're a maniac!

0x71988808 = ~z~I guess. I bet my husband's right where I left him, bottle in hand...

0x81657924 = ~z~Hey, what are you doing? Get back on your horse!

0xA7F8E151 = ~z~Oh my God! You monster!

0xA9AC8C99 = ~z~You're ass-backwards, you know that? I'm farther now than when I started!

0xA460F770 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Man barely lifts his hand to wave the flies away,~sl:0.0:2.4~aside from to lift a drink, of course.~sl:0.4~Marriage, for me, has been nothing but trouble.

0xAF4495D2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~When I asked about her, everybody told me to leave it alone.~sl:0.6:3.3~Found an old saloon there, all shut down now,~sl:0.0:4.8~but I went in to have a look and there's bullet holes, old blood stains...~sl:0.1:3.0~something definitely happened there but I couldn't figure it.~sl:0.2~Just an uncomfortable feeling to the place.

0xB47FF6EF = ~z~We ain't hardly going nowhere at this speed.

0xB49CA803 = ~z~Just can't never get a break.

0xB77CDE69 = ~z~Okay, just let me off. I'll walk from here.

0xBCC35BAA = ~z~Well. This is better than nothing I suppose. Thanks, mister.

0xBD0D2EC4 = ~z~Hey! Biscuit is barely dead and you're molesting his body?

0xBD745453 = ~z~You too. All the best.

0xC28409FE = ~z~You're a little bit off, ain't you?

0xCB6AB7CF = ~z~Oh, hey, you there! Think you could help a lady out?

0xCC838E00 = ~z~~sl:0.7~Appreciate it.

0xCD36C003 = ~z~I'll make my own way fine. Thanks though.

0xD6AD681D = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Yeah, sure, and who's gonna change things around here?~sl:0.1:3.0~You? Jameson? He'll work you to death...

0xD10ED805 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~Either way, it's time I left, especially now I lost that poor horse.~sl:0.4~I'll collect my belongings and be on my way.

0xD37E86DA = ~z~Bit indecisive, huh? Well, fair enough. I'm in no position to be proud.

0xD6564732 = ~z~~sl:1.3:4.6:1~Does he really think Jameson or any of the others give a damn whether he lives or dies?

0xDA0E2059 = ~z~Alright! Hope you ain't contagious...

0xDAFBDE6C = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~I'll be moving on soon, though. Emerald Ranch...~sl:0.1~well, it's a strange place.

0xDB5F3BB6 = ~z~Well ride on then!

0xE091EA72 = ~z~Oh, we're getting close now.

0xE369FFC3 = ~z~Hey, why are we stopped? We got a ways to go yet.

0xE82946AA = ~z~Hey, we can't walk your horse back, come on.

0xEA40D4E6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.5~The owner's a mean bastard. Strange too, delights in bullying folk.~sl:0.5:3.0~There's a daughter, but she never leaves the house...~sl:0.3~you can see her in the window sometimes.

0xEBD13FFA = ~z~You bastard!

0xEEAE18CD = ~z~Oh, thank you, sir, thank you.

0xEF3052E1 = ~z~Real generous, in your state.

0xF1F2C1DD = ~z~Please, quit riding like this!

0xF4CA6873 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~Had one of them mountain boys pull a gun on me once?~sl:0.4:4.0~I was riding up near the Dakota and had stopped by a nice warm patch.~sl:0.6:3.1~Must've dozed off, but I wake up and find some~sl:~nasty piece of work pointing a rusty shotgun straight at me.

0xF6D44840 = ~z~Might as well just have left me to walk!

0xF6E6FEFC = ~z~This is taking a long time.

0xF890B95F = ~z~Maybe go off somewhere else, huh?

0xF67443A9 = ~z~So... where was I? Oh, yes...

0xF89747FB = ~z~Anyways... right...
