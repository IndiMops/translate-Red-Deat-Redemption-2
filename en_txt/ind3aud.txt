IND3_ARTCALL1_02 = ~z~You know what? Call.

IND3_ARTRAISE1_01 = ~z~This is probably a bad idea... but I'll raise you.

IND3_ARTRAISE1_02 = ~z~I don't know why I'm doing this, but raise.

IND3_BARBDONE_1 = ~z~There, very smart.

IND3_BARBLEAVE_1 = ~z~Hope you have a successful evening, gentlemen.

IND3_BOARDWAIT_01 = ~z~After you, Arthur.

IND3_BOARDWAIT_02 = ~z~Lead the way then, Arthur. Money before looks.

IND3_BOARDWAIT_03 = ~z~Go on, dear boy. Let's go spend some of that oil money!

IND3_BOATDAWDLE_01 = ~z~Come on, let's find the others.

IND3_BOATDAWDLE_02 = ~z~Will you hurry up? They'll be leaving dock soon.

IND3_BOATDAWDLE_03 = ~z~My god, man, it's like coaxing a dog to the spaying knife.

IND3_BOSS_WAIT_01 = ~z~If you'd follow me sir.

IND3_BOSS_WAIT_02 = ~z~Is everything okay, sir?

IND3_BOSS_WAIT_03 = ~z~Just this way sir.

IND3_BOSS_WAIT_04 = ~z~This way, please.

IND3_CASH_1 = ~z~Please cash these out for me.

IND3_CHIPSTALK_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.3~Look at this... chips already stacked up waiting for me.~sl:0.7~I like this joint already.

IND3_CHIPSTALK_2 = ~z~We aim to please, sir.

IND3_COACHCHAT_1 = ~z~George. To the Grand Korrigan please.

IND3_COACHCHAT_2 = ~z~Grand Korrigan, sir.

IND3_COACHCHAT_3 = ~z~Well, look at you. From toad... to prince.

IND3_COACHCHAT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.3:0.0~This is a bit much, ain't it? The coach?

IND3_COACHCHAT_5 = ~z~We can't whinny up there on horses like a bunch of countrified yokels.

IND3_COACHCHAT_6 = ~z~You're a brash oil man with money to burn! Which reminds me... no shuffling and mumbling.

IND3_COACHCHAT_7 = ~z~Puff your chest out. Get outside yourself.

IND3_COACHCHAT_8 = ~z~~sl:0.0:5.1~Yeah, alright, alright. This ain't Hamlet. So, who's the mark?~sl:1.0~Is he alright, by the way, the driver?

IND3_COACHCHAT_9 = ~z~Oh yes, don't worry. George and I go way back.

IND3_COACHCHAT_10 = ~z~It's a man called Desmond Blythe. Made his fortune in hosiery of all things.

IND3_COACHCHAT_11 = ~z~

IND3_COACHCHAT_12 = ~z~Likes to play fast and always keeps some extra collateral in the safe, upstairs.

IND3_COACHCHAT_13 = ~z~~sl:0.7:0.0~So... if Strauss is sitting behind him, how does he know what cards I got?

IND3_COACHCHAT_14 = ~z~He won't. But the dealer has recently become a very good friend of mine.

IND3_COACHCHAT_15 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.0:1~Another one.

IND3_COACHCHAT_16 = ~z~~sl:1.0:1.6~Don't worry, Arthur...~sl:~we're all the authors of our own good fortune.

IND3_COACHCHAT_17 = ~z~He'll make sure you got the right cards.

IND3_COACHCHAT_18 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.3:1~What could possibly go wrong?

IND3_COACHCHAT_19 = ~z~Indeed.

IND3_COACHEND_1 = ~z~And what money am I playing with?

IND3_COACHEND_2 = ~z~Don't worry, that has all been arranged. Your chips will be waiting for you.

IND3_COACHRUN_01 = ~z~What are you doing? Give me strength.

IND3_COACHRUN_02 = ~z~For the love of God, just get on the coach.

IND3_COACHRUN_03 = ~z~What are you playing at? Let's go.

IND3_COACHWAIT_01 = ~z~Come on, don't look so nervous.

IND3_COACHWAIT_02 = ~z~On you get, then.

IND3_COACHWAIT_03 = ~z~Hop on and let's go, my boy... while you still look presentable.

IND3_DAWD_1 = ~z~Keeping a gentleman waiting... I don't know.

IND3_DEADEYE_1 = ~z~Shit! Let's hope no one heard that. Quick, clear the safe, let's get outta here.

IND3_DEALER_1 = ~z~Don't worry, sir, everyone is the author of his own good fortune...

IND3_DESAGRR_01 = ~z~You're just getting all the cards tonight, ain't you?

IND3_DESAGRR_02 = ~z~I like a confident man, Mr. Blythe.

IND3_DESALLIN1_1 = ~z~Okay, sorry boys, I'm taking it all.

IND3_DESALLIN2_01 = ~z~Sorry to do this to you, but I have no choice. All in.

IND3_DESALLIN2_02 = ~z~Okay, Mr. Callahan. I'm all in.

IND3_DESALLIN3_01 = ~z~Let's not waste any more time here. All in.

IND3_DESALLIN3_02 = ~z~~sl:1.3~I am one-hundred percent all in, Mr. Callahan.

IND3_DESRAISE1_01 = ~z~Come on, gentlemen, let's make this interesting.

IND3_DESRAISE1_02 = ~z~Alright, we need to get this up to something respectable.

IND3_DESRAISE2_01 = ~z~Come on, this is pocket change.

IND3_DESRAISE2_02 = ~z~There, see? That's how you raise. Easy as that.

IND3_DESRAISE3_01 = ~z~We can go higher than that.

IND3_DESRAISE3_02 = ~z~And up we go. Build me a nice big pile.

IND3_DESRAISE4_01 = ~z~Raise... or is that too high for you?

IND3_DESRAISE4_02 = ~z~You got enough chips there to go a little higher?

IND3_DESRAISE4_03 = ~z~Time to put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Callahan?

IND3_DESREACT1_01 = ~z~Like I said, Mr. Callahan... cowards.

IND3_DESREACT1_02 = ~z~Good god, are you men or mice?

IND3_DESREACT2_01 = ~z~Call, call, call...is anyone going to live a little here?

IND3_DESREACT2_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~How did I end up at this table?~sl:~I'd have more fun throwing my money overboard.

IND3_DESREACT3_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~I thought as much.~sl:0.1~Maybe you should have another drink, Mr. Callahan.

IND3_DISARMNOW_01 = ~z~Get his gun, go on.

IND3_DISARMNOW_02 = ~z~Quick, Arthur.

IND3_DISARMNOW_03 = ~z~Come on, what are you doing?

IND3_DISARM_1 = ~z~I guess you were right... only an idiot would give a greaser a gun.

IND3_DISARM_2 = ~z~

IND3_DONT_1 = ~z~Don't reach for that gun.

IND3_ESCAPE_01 = ~z~We need to get outta here!

IND3_ESCAPE_02 = ~z~Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

IND3_ESCAPE_BT1_1 = ~z~Oh, how do you suggest?

IND3_ESCAPE_BT1_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~I dont know, this ain't my show!~sl:~And silly me I clean forgot to bring my gondala.

IND3_ESCAPE_BT3_1 = ~z~Damn it, we gotta go! Come on!

IND3_ESCAPE_BT3_2 = ~z~Oh, but what about the alligators?

IND3_ESCAPE_BT4_1 = ~z~Get in there!

IND3_EXT_1 = ~z~Well...

IND3_EXT_2 = ~z~never a dull moment.

IND3_EXT_3 = ~z~Yeah, that's one way of putting it.

IND3_EXT_4 = ~z~So...

IND3_EXT_5 = ~z~how much did we get?

IND3_EXT_6 = ~z~A few thousand I think.

IND3_EXT_7 = ~z~Pretty good.

IND3_EXT_8 = ~z~Yes, indeed.

IND3_EXT_9 = ~z~And, this watch...

IND3_EXT_10 = ~z~apparently it's worth a bunch, a...

IND3_EXT_11 = ~z~Swiss, a...

IND3_EXT_12 = ~z~a Reutlinger or something?

IND3_EXT_13 = ~z~Nice watch.

IND3_EXT_14 = ~z~Yes, it's a Reutlinger alright.

IND3_EXT_15 = ~z~Well give it back then.

IND3_EXT_16 = ~z~Alright, come on.

IND3_EXT_17 = ~z~Let's get outta here.

IND3_EXT_LI_1 = ~z~

IND3_FOLD1_1 = ~z~~sl:1.2:0.0~No, I'm out. Think I'll wait for this seat to warm up a bit.

IND3_GUARD1SWIM_1 = ~z~They're trying to swim for it!

IND3_GUARD2SWIM_1 = ~z~They're in the water! Gun them down!

IND3_GUARD3SWIM_1 = ~z~Shoot them! Come on, they're getting away!

IND3_HAND1CHAT1_1 = ~z~So, how are we all faring?

IND3_HAND1CHAT1_2 = ~z~Some better than others.

IND3_HAND1CHAT1_3 = ~z~If we all fared the same in life, now where would the fun be?

IND3_HAND1CHAT1_4 = ~z~Quite.

IND3_HAND1CHAT2_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.9~Wait... not Desmond Blythe, the Hosiery King?~sl:0.5~I should have brought my other wallet.

IND3_HAND1CHAT2_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8:1~Not my preferred title, but yes... you should have.

IND3_HAND1CHAT2_3 = ~z~

IND3_HAND1CHAT2_4 = ~z~

IND3_HAND2CHAT1_1 = ~z~So what business are you in, Mr. Callahan?

IND3_HAND2CHAT1_2 = ~z~I'm an oil man, for my sins.

IND3_HAND2CHAT1_3 = ~z~Funny, I haven't heard of you.

IND3_HAND2CHAT1_4 = ~z~Oh, you will.

IND3_HAND2CHAT2_1 = ~z~You know, I thought about getting into hosiery, but... I just look better in a suit.

IND3_HAND2CHAT2_2 = ~z~I would stick to oil, Mr. Callahan. I don't think you have a future on the stage.

IND3_HAND2CHAT2_3 = ~z~You sound just like my wife.

IND3_HAND3CHAT_1 = ~z~So you must know Leviticus Cornwall, big oil man like you?

IND3_HAND3CHAT_2 = ~z~Of course. We've crossed paths.

IND3_HAND3CHAT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~I was fortunate enough to tour a little operation of his...~sl:~up in New Hanover.

IND3_HAND3RIVER_1 = ~z~Uh oh.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_1 = ~z~And... how exactly are we getting outta here?

IND3_HOWLEAVE_2 = ~z~I ain't too sure. This is what tends to happen when you leave Trelawny in charge of planning.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_3 = ~z~All garnish, no meat.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_4 = ~z~Probably involve us dressing up as dancing girls and can-caning off the side.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_5 = ~z~Nice uniform, by the way.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_6 = ~z~Thanks. They'll give anyone a job these days...

IND3_HOWLEAVE_7 = ~z~Anyway, we shouldn't give ourselves away, 'til we know we need to.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_8 = ~z~Maybe we could still blend into the crowd when it all goes crazy.

IND3_HOWLEAVE_9 = ~z~Which it surely will...

IND3_HOWLEAVE_10 = ~z~To the bar, senor!

IND3_IG1_A_1 = ~z~Make this gentleman look like the duke he really is.

IND3_IG1_A_2 = ~z~It was the English's fault his grandfather had to emigrate.

IND3_IG1_A_3 = ~z~A bitter and jealous people...

IND3_IG1_A_4 = ~z~You can see the aristocrat in his profile.

IND3_IG1_A_5 = ~z~The heavy brow, from all the inbreeding...

IND3_IG2_CMON_1 = ~z~Come on, let's get you to the barber.

IND3_IG2_CMON_2 = ~z~Sure.

IND3_IG2_WALK_1 = ~z~Herr Strauss has scoped the whole thing out, it's quite ingenious actually.

IND3_IG2_WALK_2 = ~z~What is?

IND3_IG2_WALK_3 = ~z~The action he has planned. Indeed, it's not much of an action at all.

IND3_IG2_WALK_4 = ~z~You'll play cards, and win.

IND3_IG2_WALK_5 = ~z~And you're going to bet very big and flamboyantly while you win,

IND3_IG2_WALK_6 = ~z~and everyone's going to think you're some new money from the oil fields, come to lay it on thick and drunk.

IND3_IG2_WALK_7 = ~z~All the while, Herr Strauss will be signalling you in your line of sight.

IND3_IG2_WALK_8 = ~z~When you bust the place, they'll take you upstairs to pay you off...

IND3_IG2_WALK_9 = ~z~and that is when Javier comes in and you take whatever you want.

IND3_IG2_WALK_10 = ~z~You don't think they might see an armed Mexican coming into the safe with me?

IND3_IG2_WALK_11 = ~z~Sure, they might. But perhaps not, you will see.

IND3_IG2_WALK_12 = ~z~The suspense is killing me.

IND3_IG2_WALK_13 = ~z~Oh, don't be so jaded. We both know this is just the kind of innocent fun you thrive on.

IND3_IG2_WALK_14 = ~z~Well, after the past couple of months, armed robbery don't seem such an innocent pastime.

IND3_IG2_WALK_15 = ~z~No. But we, you... all of us, will be done here soon.

IND3_IG2_WALK_16 = ~z~I hope so.

IND3_IG2_WALK_17 = ~z~~sl:1.0~Come on.

IND3_IG3_ENTER_1 = ~z~My good man... could you smarten up my dear hick friend, here?

IND3_IG3_EXIT_1 = ~z~Come on, let's get to the docks.

IND3_IG3_P1_1 = ~z~This unlikely fellow has made himself a fortune in the oil fields,

IND3_IG3_P1_2 = ~z~and learned himself not a lick of manners or gentlemanly deportment.

IND3_IG3_P2_1 = ~z~Well, very good, sir.

IND3_IG3_P2_2 = ~z~No, it's not good... not good at all!

IND3_IG3_P2_3 = ~z~Not if they're gonna let him play big at the tables tonight.

IND3_IG3_P3_1 = ~z~Make him look like a prince, sir.

IND3_IG8_HERE_1 = ~z~Well... here we are.

IND3_IG8_WALK_1 = ~z~Well, you are having quite the night!

IND3_IG8_WALK_2 = ~z~Yeah, so far.

IND3_IG8_WALK_3 = ~z~I cannot believe someone gave a greaser a job.

IND3_IG8_WALK_4 = ~z~~sl:1.2:0.0~We live in strange times.

IND3_IG8_WALK_5 = ~z~Personally, I wouldn't trust one with a gun, uh, but fear not...

IND3_IG8_WALK_6 = ~z~I've got my own little law giver right here.

IND3_IG8_WALK_7 = ~z~Very good.

IND3_IG8_WALK_8 = ~z~Next, we'll be hiring negroes.

IND3_IG8_WALK_9 = ~z~Yeah, I know... I know.

IND3_IG9_JAV_1 = ~z~

IND3_IG9_P1_1 = ~z~Just give me one second, sir.

IND3_IG9_P1_2 = ~z~Of course, take your time.

IND3_IG9_P2_1 = ~z~Idiot, huh?

IND3_IG10_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.6:1~Can't believe that asshole had another gun.

IND3_IG10_2 = ~z~~sl:0.1~The view in here is looking pretty good.

IND3_IG10_3 = ~z~How much is there?

IND3_IG10_4 = ~z~Must be a few thousand. Plus the watch.

IND3_IG10_5 = ~z~Nice. Now, let's get outta here, come on.

IND3_IG10_SURE_1 = ~z~Let's go meet the others.

IND3_IG10_SURE_2 = ~z~Sure.

IND3_IG11_A_1 = ~z~I reckon we've only got a few minutes to get out of here.

IND3_IG11_A_2 = ~z~If we're lucky.

IND3_IG11_B_1 = ~z~I hope you had fun, sir.

IND3_IG11_B_2 = ~z~~sl:0.7~The time of my life... you boys sure know how to put on a show!

IND3_IG11_B_3 = ~z~~sl:0.7:1.4:1~That's wonderful...

IND3_IG11_B_4 = ~z~Ah, look, there's your friend.

IND3_IG15_1 = ~z~Ah, there she is, come on.

IND3_IG15_2 = ~z~Okay.

IND3_IG15_3 = ~z~Arthur, leave any weaponry here. They'll search us when we get on.

IND3_IG15_4 = ~z~George, we'll collect these from you later.

IND3_IG15_5 = ~z~Very good, sir.

IND3_IG15_6 = ~z~Thank you, George.

IND3_IG15_7 = ~z~Good luck, sir.

IND3_IG18_1 = ~z~

IND3_IG18_2 = ~z~I've never seen such luck... he must have sold his soul to the devil. Twice over.

IND3_IG19_1 = ~z~Was that a gunshot?

IND3_IG19_2 = ~z~It sounded like one. C'mon!

IND3_IG_DOCKS_1 = ~z~C'mon gentlemen, champagne is on dear old Arthur.

IND3_IG_DOCKS_2 = ~z~He's rich as can be and feeling luckier than a turkey that survived Thanksgiving!

IND3_IG_DOCKS_3 = ~z~Hello gentlemen.

IND3_IG_DOCKS_4 = ~z~Hello, dear boy.

IND3_IG_DOCKS_5 = ~z~C'mon, c'mon, let's head aboard. Drinks are on Arthur... champagne...

IND3_INT_1 = ~z~Oh, there you are, my dear boy.

IND3_INT_2 = ~z~Yes, here I am.

IND3_INT_3 = ~z~Ah, there you are, dear boy.

IND3_INT_4 = ~z~Yes, here I am.

IND3_INT_5 = ~z~Well, we're going to need to get you smartened up a bit.

IND3_INT_6 = ~z~Why?

IND3_INT_7 = ~z~Well you can't play at the tables on a Lannahechee River Boat looking like this.

IND3_INT_8 = ~z~You can't?

IND3_INT_9 = ~z~Not if you want to fit in so well...

IND3_INT_10 = ~z~that no one will realize you're there to rob the place.

IND3_INT_11 = ~z~Now come on.

IND3_INT_12 = ~z~Are we still doing that?

IND3_INT_13 = ~z~Ah, there you are, dear boy.

IND3_INT_14 = ~z~Yes, here I am.

IND3_INT_15 = ~z~Well we're going to need to get you smartened up a bit.

IND3_INT_16 = ~z~What?

IND3_INT_17 = ~z~Well you can't play at the tables on a Lannahechee River Boat looking like this.

IND3_INT_18 = ~z~You can't?

IND3_INT_19 = ~z~Not if you want to fit in so well...

IND3_INT_20 = ~z~no one realizes you're there to rob the place.

IND3_INT_21 = ~z~Now come on.

IND3_INT_22 = ~z~What you talking about?

IND3_INT_LI1_1 = ~z~That suit is not fit for the purpose at hand.

IND3_INT_LI1_2 = ~z~Come along dear boy, come along.

IND3_INT_LI2_1 = ~z~Of course!

IND3_INT_LI2_2 = ~z~We are going to fix you up so fine, no one will notice a thing.

IND3_INT_LI_B_1 = ~z~Ah, there you are dear boy.

IND3_INT_LI_B_2 = ~z~Yes, here I am.

IND3_JAVIERGUN_01 = ~z~What are we supposed to do now, huh?

IND3_JAVIERGUN_02 = ~z~What's our next move here?

IND3_JAVIERGUN_03 = ~z~Where are they all coming from?

IND3_JAVIERGUN_04 = ~t~In Spanish: Motherfucker!

IND3_JAVIERGUN_05 = ~z~Let's move up, Arthur!

IND3_JAVIERSTOP_01 = ~z~Are you coming?

IND3_JAVIERSTOP_02 = ~z~Come on, this way.

IND3_JAVIERSTOP_03 = ~z~Sir... follow me... please?

IND3_JAVIERSTOP_04 = ~z~Are you alright there, sir?

IND3_JAVIERSTOP_05 = ~z~Quick as you can, sir?

IND3_KKVSAA_1 = ~z~Pair of kings.

IND3_KKVSAA_2 = ~z~Very good, but not good enough.

IND3_KKVSAA_3 = ~z~Shit.

IND3_LEAVE_01 = ~z~Arthur! Come on! We gotta go!

IND3_LEAVE_02 = ~z~Let's get outta here, Arthur!

IND3_LEAVE_03 = ~z~Are you coming? Let's go!

IND3_LEAVE_04 = ~z~What are you doing back there? Come on!

IND3_LOITER_INS_01 = ~z~Looks like there's still an open seat, sir.

IND3_LOITER_INS_02 = ~z~Are you playing tonight, sir?

IND3_LOITER_INS_03 = ~z~Feel free to join a game, sir.

IND3_LOITER_OUT_01 = ~z~The tables are inside, sir.

IND3_LOITER_OUT_02 = ~z~Going to try your luck tonight, sir?

IND3_LOITER_OUT_03 = ~z~Head on inside if you're looking to play.

IND3_LOOTNOW_01 = ~z~Clean it out, come on.

IND3_LOOTNOW_02 = ~z~Quick, let's get the money and go.

IND3_LOOTNOW_03 = ~z~Hurry, Arthur. Someone will have heard that gun go off.

IND3_MCS1_1 = ~z~Champagne...

IND3_MCS1_2 = ~z~all around.

IND3_MCS1_3 = ~z~I'm afraid we require all patrons to hand over their guns.

IND3_MCS1_4 = ~z~Good time, the tables await.

IND3_MCS1_5 = ~z~Right, I'll go find myself a change of clothes.

IND3_MCS1_6 = ~z~Okay.

IND3_MCS1_7 = ~z~You seem unsure?

IND3_MCS1_8 = ~z~Robbing a heavily armed river boat without a gun...

IND3_MCS1_9 = ~z~tends to bring out the self-doubt in me.

IND3_MCS1_10 = ~z~These people are virtually idiots.

IND3_MCS1_11 = ~z~This is simple stuff.

IND3_MCS1_12 = ~z~Now have a good time...

IND3_MCS1_13 = ~z~but don't lose too much money...

IND3_MCS1_14 = ~z~or your wife is going to kill me.

IND3_MCS1_15 = ~z~Whatever you say.

IND3_MCS1_LI_1 = ~z~

IND3_MCS1_LI_2 = ~z~I'm afraid we require all patrons to hand over their guns.

IND3_MCS1_LO_1 = ~z~Now, where can I get a cocktail?

IND3_MCS2_1 = ~z~Goodbye, gentlemen.

IND3_MCS2_2 = ~z~I guess it's just you and me now, friend.

IND3_MCS2_3 = ~z~Guess it is.

IND3_MCS2_4 = ~z~Time to see if you're really the man you seem to think you are.

IND3_MCS2_5 = ~z~Likewise, Mr. Blythe.

IND3_MCS3_1 = ~z~Shit... shit!

IND3_MCS3_2 = ~z~I guess my luck held.

IND3_MCS3_3 = ~z~Is that you done?

IND3_MCS3_4 = ~z~Done?

IND3_MCS3_5 = ~z~Bust...

IND3_MCS3_6 = ~z~or... you got something else to play with?

IND3_MCS3_7 = ~z~Meaning?

IND3_MCS3_8 = ~z~Well, I heard...

IND3_MCS3_9 = ~z~well, I heard there was some big boys on this boat.

IND3_MCS3_10 = ~z~Maybe that's not you...

IND3_MCS3_11 = ~z~no offense.

IND3_MCS3_12 = ~z~Sit your hillbilly ass down.

IND3_MCS3_13 = ~z~Why?

IND3_MCS3_14 = ~z~I got a watch.

IND3_MCS3_15 = ~z~Look at you.

IND3_MCS3_16 = ~z~An expensive one...

IND3_MCS3_17 = ~z~real fine...

IND3_MCS3_18 = ~z~Swiss...

IND3_MCS3_19 = ~z~a Reutlinger no less.

IND3_MCS3_20 = ~z~It's in the safe upstairs...

IND3_MCS3_21 = ~z~it's worth more than you.

IND3_MCS3_22 = ~z~Okay, I trust you.

IND3_MCS3_23 = ~z~Now play.

IND3_MCS3_24 = ~z~As you wish.

IND3_MCS3_LI_1 = ~z~

IND3_MCS3_LI_2 = ~z~Shit... shit!

IND3_MCS4_1 = ~z~Goddamn you...

IND3_MCS4_2 = ~z~n-no offense.

IND3_MCS4_3 = ~z~None taken.

IND3_MCS4_4 = ~z~Well played, sir.

IND3_MCS4_5 = ~z~Unlucky, Desmond.

IND3_MCS4_6 = ~z~Now...

IND3_MCS4_7 = ~z~forgive my lack of discretion, but...

IND3_MCS4_8 = ~z~where might I find this watch?

IND3_MCS4_9 = ~z~It's upstairs...

IND3_MCS4_10 = ~z~shall we go and have a look?

IND3_MCS4_11 = ~z~Why not?

IND3_MCS4_LO_1 = ~z~Gentlemen... are you new?

IND3_MCS4_LO_2 = ~z~I-I started last week.

IND3_MCS4_LO_3 = ~z~Good... sure. Perhaps you could escort us up to the office?

IND3_MCS4_LO_4 = ~z~Yes, of course, sir.

IND3_MCS4_LO_5 = ~z~Thank you.

IND3_MCS4_LO_6 = ~z~Follow me gentlemen.

IND3_MCS4_LO_7 = ~z~Come with me, sir.

IND3_MCS5_1 = ~z~There he is.

IND3_MCS5_2 = ~z~Now, don't be a sore loser, friend.

IND3_MCS5_3 = ~z~There's something I don't like about the pair of you.
