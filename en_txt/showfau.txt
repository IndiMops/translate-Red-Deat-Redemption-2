SHOWF_CRRD_BRK2_1 = ~z~Darn it, looks like a fair bit of damage here. Didn't Alden tell you to be careful?

SHOWF_CRRD_BRK2_2 = ~z~Anyway, I'll take what I can.

SHOWF_CRRD_BRK3_1 = ~z~Christ alive, what have you done to this? Most of it's wrecked!

SHOWF_CRRD_BRK3_2 = ~z~Didn't Alden tell you it was fragile?

SHOWF_CRRD_BRK3_3 = ~z~Anyway, guess I'll have to take what I can. Don't attract any attention.

SHOWF_CRRD_BRK_1 = ~z~Okay, some of this cargo's damaged but it'll do.

SHOWF_CRW_ALIVE_1 = ~z~So Old Bob Crawford was livid about his coach getting robbed. I was very sympathetic.

SHOWF_CRW_ALIVE_2 = ~z~You are a good cousin by marriage, Seamus.

SHOWF_CRW_ALIVE_3 = ~z~Oh I try. Now, anyway, I trust this ain't just a social call?

SHOWF_CRW_DEAD_1 = ~z~So I thought you was just gonna rob the Crawfords?

SHOWF_CRW_DEAD_2 = ~z~Sounds like it was went a good deal further than that...

SHOWF_CRW_DEAD_3 = ~z~I thought he was just your cousin by marriage. And your competition.

SHOWF_CRW_DEAD_4 = ~z~Well, yes, but still... Anyway, no point dwelling on the past I suppose.

SHOWF_CRW_DEAD_5 = ~z~Now I presume this ain't just a social call?

SHOWF_POST_HR0_1 = ~z~Ah, it's you.

SHOWF_SMSSICK_1 = ~z~You look like death warmed up.

SHOWF_SMSSICK_2 = ~z~Likewise, Seamus.

SHOWF_SMSSICK_3 = ~z~Well, life takes its toll on us all, don't it? But, guess we're still here.

SHOWF_SMS_JOHN_1 = ~z~How can I help you?

SHOWF_SMS_JOHN_2 = ~z~I think you knew a friend of mine a few years back. Feller called Arthur.

SHOWF_SMS_JOHN_3 = ~z~Sounds like you're a useful man to know round here.

SHOWF_SMS_JOHN_4 = ~z~I remember, that was a long time ago now. I can be useful, yes, if you can be discrete.

SHOWF_SMS_JOHN_5 = ~z~So how can I help you?
