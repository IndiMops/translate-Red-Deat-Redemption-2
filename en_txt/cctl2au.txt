CCTL2_ACTA1_1 = ~z~What you reading?

CCTL2_ACTA1_2 = ~z~Oh, some silly romance.

CCTL2_ACTA1_3 = ~z~Aren't all romances silly?

CCTL2_ACTA1_4 = ~z~Yes, and this one is particularly silly... I know you and Karen laugh at me for reading this stuff.

CCTL2_ACTA1_6 = ~z~Do you?

CCTL2_ACTA1_7 = ~z~Sometimes.

CCTL2_ACTA2_1 = ~z~What do you think, Arthur?

CCTL2_ACTB_1 = ~z~What is it about this nonsense?

CCTL2_ACTB_2 = ~z~I don't know... it makes you feel happy, even as it's making you feel sad and driving you mad for being so stupid...

CCTL2_ACTB_3 = ~z~I know.  Oh, and this one's particularly... particularly idiotic...

CCTL2_ACTB_4 = ~z~about a Scottish Lord and a princess who was raised as a peasant, but whose noble blood shines through...

CCTL2_ACTB_5 = ~z~Good grief....

CCTL2_ACTB_6 = ~z~I know.

CCTL2_ACTB_7 = ~z~Can I read it... once you're done?

CCTL2_ACTB_8 = ~z~Of course.

CCTL2_ACTB_9 = ~z~Just don't tell Karen.
