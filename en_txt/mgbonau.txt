MGBON_ACCEPT_01 = ~z~Okay, thank you.

MGBON_ACCEPT_02 = ~z~Alright, good luck.

MGBON_ACCEPT_03 = ~z~Much appreciated, hope it works out.

MGBON_ACT_AGG_01 = ~z~What are you doing? Cut that out.

MGBON_ACT_AGG_02 = ~z~Stop being an idiot.

MGBON_ACT_AGG_03 = ~z~What the hell?

MGBON_AGGRESS_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~If you think you're getting any more work~sl:~after what you just did, you're sorely mistaken.

MGBON_AGGRESS_02 = ~z~You've got some nerve coming back here, after what you did.

MGBON_AGGRESS_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Why would you think you're welcome back here?~sl:0.1~Just go away, will you?

MGBON_AIM_01 = ~z~Watch where you're pointing that thing.

MGBON_AIM_02 = ~z~What are you doing? Put that down.

MGBON_AIM_03 = ~z~Hey, that's how people get hurt.

MGBON_APPROACH_01 = ~z~Oh, I'm glad you came back through.

MGBON_APPROACH_02 = ~z~Are you looking for more work?

MGBON_APPROACH_03 = ~z~Hey, you're just the person I need.

MGBON_APPROACH_04 = ~z~Hello, are you looking for work? We could really use some help.

MGBON_APPROACH_05 = ~z~Oh, it's you. Nice to see you. You free to help out a little?

MGBON_APPROACH_06 = ~z~Nice to see you, can I ask a favor of you?

MGBON_APPROACH_07 = ~z~You looking for work?

MGBON_BOUNTY_01 = ~z~I can't risk dealing with you while you've got a price on your head.

MGBON_BOUNTY_02 = ~z~Why don't you come back when you've paid off your bounty?

MGBON_BOUNTY_03 = ~z~I've got nothing for you. You think I haven't heard about the price on your head?

MGBON_CE_RIDG_1 = ~z~Good, plenty to do 'round here.

MGBON_CE_RIDG_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~A group of laborers arrived looking for work,~sl:0.3~but we're trying to wind things down here in the hope that...

MGBON_CE_RIDG_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~my father and I will actually leave on this trip~sl:0.0:1.3~while I'm still young.~sl:0.6:1.7~He's a stubborn goat...~sl:0.5~but then, he is a man, so... of course he is.

MGBON_CE_RIDG_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~Anyway, these are good workers, good people.~sl:0.2~And they need to earn some money.

MGBON_CE_RIDG_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.6~So I'm going to send them over to Ridgewood Farm.~sl:0.2~I know they're looking for some extra hands.

MGBON_CE_RIDG_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Problem is, this Del Lobos gang has been holding up~sl:0.0:2.3~pretty much every wagon crossing the desert,~sl:0.4~so they need an escort.

MGBON_CE_RIDG_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.8~If you can ride with them, I'd really appreciate it.~sl:1.0~I just don't have the time, right now.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Thank you, there's so much to do.~sl:0.4:2.4~This sickness in Armadillo, you must have heard about it...~sl:~it's decimating the town.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~They've had to start burning the bodies~sl:~because they can't bury them fast enough.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_3 = ~z~The undertaker must be the richest man in New Austin.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~And as if things couldn't get any worse,~sl:0.2~this Del Lobo gang is running amok.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~We've been doing our best to get people east out of the county,~sl:0.4~but those degenerate bastards... keep on robbing them.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~There's a group here we're trying to get to Thieves' Landing,~sl:0.0:2.5~so they can cross over into West Elizabeth,~sl:0.1~but they need some protection.

MGBON_CE_TLAN_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~Do you think you can escort them there safely?~sl:0.6~We'll pay you for it, of course.

MGBON_COOLDOWN_01 = ~z~I don't want to talk to you right now.

MGBON_COOLDOWN_02 = ~z~I'm still not ready to talk to you.

MGBON_COOLDOWN_03 = ~z~I still haven't forgotten what you did.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_1 = ~z~Oh good, good. Just in time.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~We're still trying to get ready to leave on this trip, my father and I,~sl:~but there's just so much to do.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.0~And he's off gallivanting, God knows where again.~sl:0.3:2.4~And I'm just expected to deal with it all...~sl:0.2~not that I'm complaining.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~I know he's been through a lot, losing so many sons...~sl:0.6~but I lost my brothers.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:0.7~Okay.~sl:1.0:1.8~So, maybe I'm complaining a little.~sl:0.3~I think we both need to get away from this place for a while.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~Anyway, I've been trying to get things cleared up~sl:0.0:1.1~around here and...~sl:0.1:2.4~there's a few bags behind the house of bits and bobs~sl:~I've been meaning to drop off with the neighbors.

MGBON_DMB_MCF_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~If you could do that for me, it would really be a big help.~sl:0.7~So... what do you think?

MGBON_ESCALATE_01 = ~z~You stop that right now.

MGBON_ESCALATE_02 = ~z~Enough, dammit.

MGBON_ESCALATE_03 = ~z~I won't tell you again.

MGBON_FAILED_LM_01 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~What happened with that last job?~sl:0.4~I don't know if I should give you another chance or not.

MGBON_FAILED_LM_02 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~When I give someone work, I expect them to complete it.~sl:0.7~But, I suppose I can give you another shot.

MGBON_FAILED_LM_03 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I'm a little disappointed in you after last time,~sl:0.2~are you here to redeem yourself?

MGBON_FAIL_01 = ~z~Oh no, what the hell happened?

MGBON_FAIL_02 = ~z~That's a real shame, I was counting on you.

MGBON_FAIL_03 = ~z~Well, that's a little disappointing, I must say.

MGBON_G1_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~I'm glad you're here...~sl:0.3:2.1~my brother wrote to me from the city.~sl:0.9~Some of his... friends need a favour.

MGBON_G1_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~Strutting around in his suit and tie~sl:~while we flog ourselves to death here.

MGBON_G1_TAKE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~But it's his life, and I still love him...~sl:0.4~so if you could do this for me, I'd really appreciate it.

MGBON_G1_TAKE_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~Hell, maybe he'll even come to visit.~sl:1.4~Thank you.

MGBON_G2_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Okay... a friend of mine left me this note.~sl:0.9:1.8~She was being very secretive.~sl:~Not one for breaking the rules.

MGBON_G2_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~You can try to do things by the book, but sometimes you~sl:~just have to throw the book out the window.

MGBON_G2_TAKE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.5~This seemed pretty important to her, so...~sl:0.0:2.0~I'd certainly appreciate the help.~sl:0.7:3.0~And we'll pay you for it. Of course.~sl:1.3~Thank you.

MGBON_G3_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.0~Okay then, I wrote this down so I wouldn't forget all the details...~sl:0.5~so much going on, at the moment.

MGBON_G3_TAKE_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Between the packing and trying to find a tenant farmer~sl:~to manage this place while we're away... well...

MGBON_G3_TAKE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Anyway, I could sure use some help with this.~sl:0.9:2.3~One weight off my mind, at least.~sl:1.2~Thank you, again.

MGBON_G4_OUT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Right, so my father gave me a note before he left on his ride...~sl:0.4~perhaps you could look into this for me?

MGBON_G4_TAKE_1 = ~z~Why he couldn't have just spoken to me about it, I don't know.

MGBON_G4_TAKE_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.4~Apparently, the great and noble Drew MacFarlane likes to keep~sl:0.0:2.0~his dirty work under the table.~sl:0.9~Best place for it, I suppose.

MGBON_G4_TAKE_3 = ~z~~sl:0.4~Well, good day to you.

MGBON_H_HIGH_01 = ~z~Sorry, all I've got right now is fairly sordid business, not really suitable for you.

MGBON_H_HIGH_02 = ~z~Look, you're a good person, and all I've got is bad work. I don't want to drag you into it.

MGBON_H_HIGH_03 = ~z~The thing I need help with right now...it's dirty work. Not for you, I'm afraid.

MGBON_H_LOW_01 = ~z~I've got nothing for you. I've heard about the way you've been acting.

MGBON_H_LOW_02 = ~z~I've heard about you. And I don't think you're the sort of person I want working for me.

MGBON_H_LOW_03 = ~z~Sorry, until you learn to treat folks right, you're not getting another cent out of me.

MGBON_IDLETIME_01 = ~z~You need to get going, there isn't much time.

MGBON_IDLETIME_02 = ~z~Quick as you can, please, we don't have a lot of time.

MGBON_IDLETIME_03 = ~z~Go on, please, this is a pretty urgent situation.

MGBON_IDLE_01 = ~z~Well, you should really get going.

MGBON_IDLE_02 = ~z~Well, off you go then.

MGBON_IDLE_03 = ~z~The sooner you can deal with this, the better.

MGBON_ILO_01 = ~z~So, you can help me?

MGBON_ILO_02 = ~z~So, you want to make some money?

MGBON_ILO_03 = ~z~Have you got the time to help me out?

MGBON_INT_1 = ~z~Can I help you?

MGBON_INT_2 = ~z~Oh, please don't tell me you've come a robbing.

MGBON_INT_3 = ~z~I haven't got the time.

MGBON_INT_4 = ~z~Or you just looking for work?

MGBON_INT_5 = ~z~Talkative one ain't you?

MGBON_INT_6 = ~z~We're trying to get packed up.

MGBON_INT_7 = ~z~My father wants to go on a trip...

MGBON_INT_8 = ~z~avoid the illness that's plaguing the county.

MGBON_INT_9 = ~z~He's never run away from anything in his life.

MGBON_INT_10 = ~z~At least that's the way he tells it...

MGBON_INT_11 = ~z~and now this.

MGBON_INT_12 = ~z~Mabel!

MGBON_INT_13 = ~z~Please pack all my dresses!

MGBON_INT_14 = ~z~And both the guns!

MGBON_INT_15 = ~z~Yes, Miss MacFarlane.

MGBON_INT_16 = ~z~Sweet girl...

MGBON_INT_17 = ~z~but to call her a village idiot would be unkind to most idiots.

MGBON_INT_18 = ~z~Miss MacFarlane.

MGBON_INT_19 = ~z~Yes, Amos?

MGBON_INT_20 = ~z~The wagon, uh...

MGBON_INT_21 = ~z~the wagon...

MGBON_INT_22 = ~z~it's gone.

MGBON_INT_23 = ~z~Gone where precisely?

MGBON_INT_24 = ~z~Well, we don't know.

MGBON_INT_25 = ~z~That's what gone means.

MGBON_INT_26 = ~z~It means that you cannot find it.

MGBON_INT_27 = ~z~Well, actually on a point of order, it doesn't...

MGBON_INT_28 = ~z~but let's not get lost in semantics.

MGBON_INT_29 = ~z~Any clue as to where it might be?

MGBON_INT_30 = ~z~I suppose...

MGBON_INT_31 = ~z~maybe Jimmy used it to take his mother to the doctor.

MGBON_INT_32 = ~z~He was riding through some nasty country.

MGBON_INT_33 = ~z~Goddammit.

MGBON_INT_34 = ~z~Excuse me.

MGBON_INT_35 = ~z~Amos, get on with the milking.

MGBON_INT_36 = ~z~Yes, Miss MacFarlane.

MGBON_INT_37 = ~z~You wouldn't, you wouldn't mind trying to find...

MGBON_INT_38 = ~z~this damn wagon would you?

MGBON_INT_39 = ~z~I'll pay you handsomely.

MGBON_INT_40 = ~z~We're very short handed right now.

MGBON_INT_41 = ~z~Thank you.

MGBON_INT_42 = ~z~Thank you very much.

MGBON_INT_43 = ~z~And good luck!

MGBON_JB_DMB_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~Thank you... thank you.~sl:1.8~It's the illness, you see. People are dropping like flies.

MGBON_JB_DMB_2 = ~z~It's sad, really... this whole country.

MGBON_JB_DMB_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~My father thought it would turn into the new Eden.~sl:0.6:5.6~That sure as hell ain't happening... but... we'll survive.~sl:0.2~We tend to.

MGBON_JB_DMB_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Anyway... there's so much to do, so much, and...~sl:~so few people to help.

MGBON_JB_DMB_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~You know what would be an enormous help...~sl:~if you could deliver some bags from behind the house.

MGBON_JB_DMB_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~It's things we've borrowed, and owe people, and such like...~sl:0.4:2.3~all things we must pay back if we're ever to~sl:~leave with our heads held high...

MGBON_JB_DMB_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.1~We'll still be here a while yet, so...~sl:~come back if you're in the neighborhood.

MGBON_JB_GENT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~I know they'd appreciate it~sl:~and I'd be very happy as they'd leave me alone.

MGBON_JB_GENT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~I tell you, for a lot of independent-minded types,~sl:~this county sure is full of folks asking for help.

MGBON_JB_GENT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.6:1.7~Including me, I guess...~sl:2.3~good day to you.

MGBON_JB_GEN_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~Good, because my cousin just sent me this letter.~sl:1.6~Take a read... perhaps you can help them?

MGBON_JB_OTH_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~Wonderful. My neighbor's been asking for help with a bear~sl:~that's been persecuting him and his family.

MGBON_JB_OTH_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~To be honest, he's something of a whiner.~sl:0.5~I can't stand him, and never could, he...

MGBON_JB_OTH_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.6~His wife was awful to my mother when she got sick.~sl:1.1:2.1~But we must try to be neighborly,~sl:~so he's asked my father to kill the thing.

MGBON_JB_OTH_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.2~Now, the last thing I need is my father off on a two-day bear hunt~sl:0.1~when he's meant to be writing letters and taking on an overseer.

MGBON_JB_OTH_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.5~Don't even ask... it's all so pathetic.~sl:0.7:2.9~But if you'd go kill this bear, then my honor~sl:~and my idiot neighbor's family will both be preserved.

MGBON_JB_OTH_6 = ~z~Yes, it's quite as silly as it sounds, even to me.

MGBON_JB_RW_1 = ~z~Good... at least someone hasn't come robbing.

MGBON_JB_RW_2 = ~z~I tell you, there's nothing like a little plague infestation to really show your neighbors and fellow countrymen in their true colors.

MGBON_JB_RW_3 = ~z~The whole county has gone to the dogs... we've been robbed again... I've no idea quite by whom.

MGBON_JB_RW_4 = ~z~But they took a wagon we cannot afford to lose... will you go get it back?

MGBON_JB_RW_5 = ~z~From my understanding they're somewhere near Brittlebrush Trawl.

MGBON_JB_RW_6 = ~z~I will of course pay you for your trouble. Thank you and try to stay safe.

MGBON_LEAVEN_01 = ~z~Time for you to go.

MGBON_LEAVEN_02 = ~z~It's time you left now.

MGBON_LEAVEN_03 = ~z~I think you should leave. Now.

MGBON_LEAVE_01 = ~z~You need to get out of here.

MGBON_LEAVE_02 = ~z~That's it, you need to leave.

MGBON_LEAVE_03 = ~z~Okay, it's time you got the hell out of here.

MGBON_LOCKED_01 = ~z~Can you come back later?

MGBON_LOCKED_02 = ~z~Sorry, this isn't a good time.

MGBON_LOCKED_03 = ~z~Sorry, I can't talk right now. Can you come back?

MGBON_M_CLDOWN_01 = ~z~I don't have anything like last time yet, sorry.

MGBON_M_CLDOWN_02 = ~z~Nothing else for you yet on this front, I'm afraid.

MGBON_M_CLDOWN_03 = ~z~Sorry, I don't have any more of this kind of work right now.

MGBON_M_LOCKED_01 = ~z~I still need to work out a few details. Can you come back later?

MGBON_M_LOCKED_02 = ~z~Sorry, I'm not quite ready for you yet.

MGBON_M_LOCKED_03 = ~z~Sorry, I don't have anything for you just yet. Can you come back later?

MGBON_NOT_GL_01 = ~z~I don't have anything for you right now.

MGBON_NOT_GL_02 = ~z~Sorry, I don't really have any work going right now.

MGBON_NOT_GL_03 = ~z~Sorry, I'm not sure I have anything suitable for you at the moment.

MGBON_NO_AVAIL_01 = ~z~I don't have anything for you right now.

MGBON_NO_AVAIL_02 = ~z~Sorry, nothing going right now.

MGBON_NO_AVAIL_03 = ~z~Sorry, the work's dried up for the time being.

MGBON_OG_STIL_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.2~Okay, so this is going to sound a little strange and ridiculous,~sl:0.6:0.7~but...~sl:0.3~I'm just going to come out and say it.

MGBON_OG_STIL_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.2~My father's been very down...~sl:~the sooner we get out of here for a while, the better...

MGBON_OG_STIL_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~and I want to get him something to cheer him up a little...~sl:0.4:1.6~if that's even possible.~sl:0.4~He's not an easy person to buy gifts for.

MGBON_OG_STIL_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.7~But he's talked more than once about these alligator boots~sl:~he saw when he was traveling through Lemoyne.

MGBON_OG_STIL_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.3~And a feller at Thieves' Landing said,~sl:~if I get him the materials, he'd make some for me.

MGBON_OG_STIL_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.3~But I hardly have time to be off reptile hunting...~sl:0.4~which is where you come in.

MGBON_OG_STIL_7 = ~z~~sl:0.8~See? Just as ridiculous as promised.

MGBON_OH_BRIT_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~Okay, good. I was going to deal with this myself,~sl:~but I have a hundred other things to do today.

MGBON_OH_BRIT_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.4~We've been having problems with a cougar.~sl:0.3~Coming here and killing livestock.

MGBON_OH_BRIT_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~My father's ranting and raving,~sl:0.0:2.3~saying he's going to go hunt it down himself,~sl:0.4~but I'm worried about his health right now.

MGBON_OH_BRIT_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~If you could kill the damn thing for me,~sl:0.0:2.1~it'd be a weight off my mind~sl:~and I'll pay you, of course.

MGBON_OH_BRIT_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:3.1~Just one thing, and I know this sounds ridiculous,~sl:0.2~but would you bring the carcass back here?

MGBON_OH_BRIT_6 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~It's the only way I'll be able to convince my father.~sl:0.3~His dear daughter's word is never enough, I'm afraid.

MGBON_OH_BRIT_7 = ~z~If it sounds petty and annoying, that's because it is.

MGBON_OH_HANG_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~Oh, good. We have a bit of a problem.~sl:0.3~A cougar killed a man camping over in Cholla Springs.

MGBON_OH_HANG_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.7~They don't attack humans too often,~sl:0.2:2.3~but a boy was mauled near there last week too,~sl:~so this animal's clearly got a bent for it.

MGBON_OH_HANG_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.9~A group of us have put up a reward~sl:~for anyone that kills and brings it in.

MGBON_OH_HANG_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.2~Amos has ridden over there,~sl:0.0:3.0~but he's got as much as chance of catching that thing...~sl:0.3~as a one-legged man in a kicking competition, I'm afraid.

MGBON_OH_HANG_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.8~He's a decent ranchhand,~sl:0.1~but shooting ain't his strong suit, poor feller.

MGBON_OH_HANG_6 = ~z~If you could deal with this, a lot of folks would sleep much easier.

MGBON_OH_HANG_7 = ~z~~sl:0.0:4.1:1~I'd go myself, but I'm just up to my eyes in it here.

MGBON_PASSED_LM_01 = ~z~Well done with that last job.

MGBON_PASSED_LM_02 = ~z~You really helped me out last time, thank you.

MGBON_PASSED_LM_03 = ~z~Good to see you. That last thing worked out well.

MGBON_PASS_01 = ~z~Good work, thank you.

MGBON_PASS_02 = ~z~Excellent, well done.

MGBON_PASS_03 = ~z~See, I knew you were the right person for this.

MGBON_POSSE_SML_01 = ~z~You'll need to round up some more folks for this one.

MGBON_POSSE_SML_02 = ~z~Sorry, this job is going to need some more hands.

MGBON_POSSE_SML_03 = ~z~Sorry, you're going to need some more folks for this. Big job.

MGBON_PREINT_01 = ~z~Get off my property.

MGBON_PREINT_02 = ~z~Who are you?

MGBON_PREINT_03 = ~z~What are you doing here?

MGBON_PREINT_04 = ~z~This is private land.

MGBON_PREINT_05 = ~z~You can't just walk in here unannounced.

MGBON_PUSH_01 = ~z~What are you doing?

MGBON_PUSH_02 = ~z~Watch it.

MGBON_PUSH_03 = ~z~Hey.

MGBON_RB_LMR_1 = ~z~Okay... so this is a little embarrassing, but I trust you.

MGBON_RB_LMR_2 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.8~My old governess, she lives in Blackwater now.~sl:0.3:2.3~She came to us to say that her husband's boat~sl:~was stolen on the Lower Montana river.

MGBON_RB_LMR_3 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.9~And yes, I did have a governess for a few years...~sl:0.5~guess my father briefly pictured a different future for me.

MGBON_RB_LMR_4 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.7~She taught me Latin and iambic pentameters...~sl:0.0:2.7:1~all the essentials for running a ranch.

MGBON_RB_LMR_5 = ~z~~sl:0.0:2.0~Do you think you could go get it back for them?~sl:~You can drop it off at Thieves' Landing.

MGBON_RB_LMR_6 = ~z~Thank you, I... know this is ridiculous.

MGBON_RB_QKRS_1 = ~z~~sl:0.0:1.5~Am I glad to see you.~sl:0.3:2.5~A friend of ours has had his boat stolen.~sl:0.5~Always something 'round here.

MGBON_RB_QKRS_2 = ~z~He's from Tumbleweed, maybe you know it? It's out west of here.
