When the U.S. Army's 7th 5th Cavalry and the honorable Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Everett Yarbrough sought to discuss matters peacefully, a skirmish broke out, and thanks to the Henry Repeater, many of the combatants were killed. Sadly, Yarbrough was not supplied with enough Henry Repeaters and all perished that day. We offer this repeating rifle as a memento to the brave men that perished defending decency, honor, gold and oil prospecting and working in an effort to bring civilization to the uncivilized.

Horace Pickens wrote us to say, “My pa bought me the Lancaster Springfield Rifle from your outfit when I was a boy, right before he got hurt something terrible in a goring accident. I spent my days shootin' and practicin', and one afternoon I was fishing for catfish when Laretta Spangler showed up to do some fishin' too. I knew her from before I dropped out of school and was mighty taken by her. I went to doin' my best to court her but nothing worked. One day I said I could shoot a pine cone out of her teeth and she said to me 'Horace, if you can do such a thing I'll marry you tomorrow.' Well I looked down that sight and squeezed that trigger and heard her scream and land sakes she was hoppin' around holding her tooth I'd chipped. We got married when she turned 13 and had our first boy the next year.”

It is in our judgement that many repeater manufacturers exact a high profit on repeaters, as do retailers, however as we are the CHEAPEST SUPPLY HOUSE ON EARTH we strive to make sure that you have the weapons you need to guard the fidelity of your cattle or daughter with equal measure. When it comes to the Buck Carbine Repeater, there is little in the world more dependable, save a trusty steed or a good dog.

I sat up with that Pump-Action Shotgun from your outfit and made that tell-tale sound of racking one in the chamber. I tell you he shut his trap right away, and I got me some sleep that night.”

0x90CDEA18 = The Elephant Gun is aptly named as many explorers soon found elephants to be a deadly nuisance and pest and are only of any use for their ivory tusks. Native to the brutal lands of India and Africa, they create an absurd amount of manure, flatten and consume crops with no appeasement of hunger evident, and will panic without reason and stomp a family to death in a manner of seconds. They are more dangerous than even a rhinoceros or lion. They cannot be eaten as their meat is too thick for a man to chew and any stew containing elephant takes days to cook and tenderize, leaving the camp starving for provisions. Any beast with a long nose is not to be trusted, whether it consumes ants, is British, or fancies its snout as a bathing device. The Elephant Gun Rifle from Mühlberg is a marvel of manufacturing and has been likened to holding a cannon. Fire it and see if you are still standing or able to hear anything other than ringing for several days.~n~

Marshall John Campbell emerged from the saloon where he was in the process of becoming heavily intoxicated. Words were exchanged between Gleeson and the Mexican gentlemen. Campbell's two pistols came out and he yelled, “Jim, I've got you covered!” He pulled the trigger and the gun jammed as he fell backwards and slumped against the saloon door. Gleeson went for his pistol and I aimed and shot it out of his hand, breaking his wrist. The Mexican gentlemen were satisfied and no blood was shed that day.”~n~

Combined with the English preacher's boots, grey union shirt and leather banded bulldogger hat, this ensemble will be found worn by him that requires the leading style but wants more for his money, a man at ease with hard work and the respite that deservedly follows. He is, at times, a martinet, calling out loiterers with spoiled tempers who might cause worry to ladies in presence. Yes, his name does fall into unfortunate gossip. His faults and foibles are literally laid out on his sleeve. We have no desire to crown him with a halo, for nobody is born perfect. Yet you would be hard pressed to, with all his faults and failings, find a man superior in virtue. He is the reason the commonwealth is strong. He rises at daybreak, performs his tasks, accepts his pay, tips his hat to the young lady outside the dry goods store, and walks home in the crimson hues of the setting sun, listening to the cicadas hum in the heat of the evening.~n~

Truth be known, many colorful characters have brandished this very revolver in some of the most famous altercations of American westward expansion and the War Between the States. While coined as a "Navy" revolver, it was not a service revolver used by naval seamen. The "Army" or "Navy" designation of firearms refers to the caliber of barrel.

I have not been, but he tells me it is a Christian place without vice, and I trust that it is so. We are often snowbound here and I weep in recalling the incident that is the reason I write to you. I was baking some fruit cakes on Christmas morning, in the hope that by some miracle my beloved husband would return after having been away for so many months. A knock at the door startled me. It was a man from town, having travelled many miles through snow. He proceeded to inform me that word had been received from the recent coach delivery that my husband had been involved in an altercation at some house of ill repute while cavorting with lewd women and was spending some time in jail. I took this to mean this man aimed to court me and bed me in a carnal way. I grabbed that Mauser and put a bullet right between his eyes and prayed the Lord to deliver his soul from his lying and lecherous ways. I thank you for your service to women such as myself. Good day.”

By unloading all eight cartridges into eight separate beer barrels, the crowd rushed to fill their glasses with the dispatching ale and rose a mug to one of Europe's finest armament manufacturers. This imported semi-auto pistol was demonstrated by Herr Janssens who visited our offices and outdoor shooting range – securing 49 of 50 shots at 100 yards even after several mugs of ale. In fact, the rapidity of fire from this firearm had all the boys in agreement that it is the greatest thing they ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The reloading is repeated as fast as one can pull the trigger so that the shooter can fire 8 shots in about half a second. Automatic pistols are mostly known to be used for civil life however they were quickly adopted by the Army for rousing enemies from the trenches.

A young boy took notice and I confronted the would-be thief, who began firing a shotgun at me. We exchanged several rounds, and my LeMat had gone empty when he charged and knocked me to the ground, having full intention to kill me dead. I then remembered that there was a second barrel and, having fired that, shot him between the eyes, of great concern to his new widow."~n~

I suspect laudanum or some opium was the base of that tincture, for they were suddenly rabid in possessing more of the cure. I returned home in the autumn to find them taking more and more doses of that vile concoction, mama pounding the hymnal with her crooked hands and singing to the ceiling Psalms of one kind or the other. When that foul medicine man came around the next week with crates of the stuff and a big smile on his face, I revealed your sawed off wonder from underneath my knitting and boy did he holler out like a chicken stuffed in a flour bag headed for the butcher's block, and that's right where I was about to take him.

Having a terrible feud with our neighbors for as far as anyone can care to remember, they came and accused us of grazing cattle on their pasture and soiling the river. My Pa got into some very terse words and shots rang out from their side. I hobbled to the porch and fanned that revolver with my crippled left arm, and left them dead and dying where they once stood.

My boy let out a cry – I thought he had burnt himself on the iron pot over the fire we was using for boiling them cans. But I looked out the window and see what looked to be three Arikara Indians coming over the ridge. I grabbed my Carcano and sighted the big one in the middle and was just about to squeeze the trigger when something didn't sit right about the feller. For one he didn't have the grace nor the physique I had seen exhibited by Indians in the past. As he drew up closer, I come to see it was my three brothers come to visit all dressed up foolish on Halloween. We laugh about that day every year. If I hadn't such a good sight on that Carcano, I would have made a widow that day. I thank you for your fine supply house and catalogue. It brings joy to my boy especially, who is slow.”~n~

Then I spied down the river a piece some maidens who were doing the washing and hanging linens and laundry up to dry. I grabbed my Litchfield Rolling Block Rifle so I could obtain a better perspective. Imagine my sentiments when through the powerful lens atop that rifle I could see the washwomen were not only cleaning the clothes in the river, but had disrobed and were cleaning one another. I recognized one to be the handsome stable girl that worked at the Henderson's ranch. She had rejected my advances at the spring barn dance. Yet here she was, with four others, frolicking in birthday suits in the Tallahassee River. The thought crossed my mind to squeeze that trigger and insure my name would be remembered among the women of that valley for years to come. However I was so quaking in my excitement at what was unfolding in front of me I nary could have squeezed off an accurate shot. That moment resonates with me and gives me pleasure, especially during hard cold winters when I do not encounter another living soul for months at a time. I thank your company for providing such a useful device.”~n~

Or that a squib load has resulted in catastrophe and loss of an eye. We take great pleasure in informing our customers that this is in no way the fault of the catalogue house, manufacturer, nor intermediaries. It is due to carelessness and neglect on the part of the owner, who may use a weapon and then put it by the side of the front door or bathroom, or lay it on a rock and become inebriated. Pitting and spots inside the barrel can be easily prevented by cleaning and oiling rifle barrels after shooting. It is a foolish man that does not treat his tools with the utmost respect, for they put meat on the table and command respect from others. If pitting does occur, we must charge $1.50 to re-bore and re-polish. Using gun oil, cleaning and boring, and keeping your rifle in a cool dry place such as under your pillow will result in safety and satisfaction for many years of use.~n~
